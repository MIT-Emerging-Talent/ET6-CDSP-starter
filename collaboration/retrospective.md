## Stop Doing

- Delaying responses to team inquiries or surveys, which can block progress.  
- Assuming others will follow up everyone should take initiative when possible.  
- Overlooking the importance of documenting small but important decisions.  
- Neglecting structured notetaking during meetings.  

---

## Continue Doing

- Using Zoom and digital tools (Slack and WhatsApp) to facilitate clear communication.  
- Introducing team members and establishing familiarity early on.  
- Respectfully collaborating and sharing responsibilities.  
- Following planned workflows and rotating reviewer assignments.  
- Scheduling time based on availability to ensure participation and balance.

## Start Doing

- Fully utilizing GitHub Issues and the Project board to plan, assign, and track progress.  
- Documenting key decisions, responsibilities, and blockers during meetings.  
- Deleting outdated branches immediately after PR merges.  
- Syncing schedules and responsibilities early to reduce delays and miscommunication.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Team members introduced themselves and established communication protocols.  
- Task division began early, creating momentum and direction.  
- Collaboration tools were set up proactively (Zoom, Slack, WhatsApp).  

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Not all tasks were added to the project board during the initial planning phase.  
- Meeting notes and responsibilities were not fully documented for future reference.  

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Yes. WhatsApp was added alongside Slack for more casual or instant coordination.  
- Time availability planning was added as part of the onboarding discussion.  

### Or remove extra steps?

- Not applicable at this stage. Since this was our first meeting, the focus was on introductions and setup. In future meetings, we aim to create a clear agenda to stay focused and make the best use of everyone's time.
