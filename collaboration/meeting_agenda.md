## Content of each meeting

### June 6th, 2 PM

- How to define a question  
  - Be very specific  
  - Expect your question to change while doing more research  
- Domain of interest of group members  
- Choosing the right research question  
  - Keep availability of data in mind  
- Ideas to use image analysis  
  - Explored applying image analysis in research domains like:  
    - Deforestation  
    - Biology  
    - Healthcare  
- Consider difficulty of research question when proposing  
  - Too easy > Too difficult  
- Elaborate on image analysis

**_What to prepare for the next meeting?_**  

- On Wednesday, come to the meeting with one or more research questions
- Investigate whether image analysis is feasible or too difficult

### June 11th, 5PM EST

#### Key Discussion Points

##### Proposed Research Questions

1. How can online access to education support learning continuity during
pandemics and humanitarian crises such as refugee displacement?
2. What is the impact of wildfire exposure on respiratory health in  Canada,
 and how can it be quantified?
3. To what extent can the use of antidepressants and economic indicators in
small economies reflect the overall happiness and mental well-being of a population?
4. Can natural language processing (NLP) techniques be used to classify judicial
decisions as punitive or restorative based on the language in court judgments?
5. How effective is image analysis in detecting early signs of deforestation as
an indicator of climate change?
   - Use vegetation index to train model.
   - Many free images over several years are available online (1984–today).
   - Recommended dataset: Global Forest Watch (2000–present).
   - Consider region-bound analysis.
   - Optionally incorporate air quality data from WorldAQ (e.g., CO₂ spikes as indicators).

##### Platform Migration

It was agreed that all ongoing chats and discussions will move to _Slack_ to
ensure better tracking and visibility for the MIT team.

##### Next Steps

- A follow-up meeting is scheduled for tomorrow to finalize the research topic.
- _Asia_ suggested that each member brings at least one research topic idea
to the next meeting.
- The group will then brainstorm collectively to narrow the suggestions down to
a concise, group-approved research focus.

### June 15th, 5PM EST

#### Review of Identified Group Research Topic

- Final confirmation of the selected research topic; "How effective is Satellite
Image Analysis at Predicting Deforestation in Malaysia?"
- Clarification of objectives and scope  

#### Distributed Group Work

- Task allocation and responsibilities  
- Timeline and milestones leading up to **June 16** deadline  

#### Planning for the Next Meeting

- Agreed on next meeting date, June 16th, 2025.

#### Collaboration Folder Setup

- All members are encouraged to complete their tasks in the collaborations
folder as soon as possible.
