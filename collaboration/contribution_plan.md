# 📌 Contribution Plan for Effective Virtual Collaboration  

## Working Document – Subject to Ongoing Edits

This plan outlines how we’ll work together smoothly and productively as a 5-person virtual group. We’ll use **Slack**, **Google Docs**, and **Google Meet** for communication, collaboration, and meetings. This version focuses on our early phase: developing a research question and conducting preliminary research.

## 1. Roles & Responsibilities (Rotating Weekly/Biweekly)

To ensure balanced workload and skill-building, we'll rotate roles regularly. This encourages shared responsibility and prevents burnout.

### ✅ Rotating Roles

#### 🟦 Project Facilitator

- Schedules and leads meetings (Google Meet)  
- Shares meeting agendas on Slack at least 24 hours before  
- Keeps meetings focused and ensures all voices are heard  
- Posts meeting summary and action items to Google Docs and Slack afterward  

#### 🟩 Research Lead

- Leads strategy for identifying potential research questions and sources  
- Facilitates discussions on literature and data exploration  
- Organizes research findings in Google Docs  

#### 🟨 Documentation & Communication Coordinator

- Maintains centralized project notes, findings, and document versions in Google Docs  
- Ensures key decisions/resources are documented and accessible  
- Drafts reports or slides related to the research question  
- Crafts clear Slack posts for group announcements or requests  

### 🔁 Shared Responsibilities (Everyone)

- Brainstorming, literature review, data collection  
- Task execution, peer feedback, and supporting each other

## 2. Communication & Collaboration Tools

### 💬 Slack – Daily Hub for Updates

- **Response Time**: Aim to respond or react by **9 PM EST** daily  

**Channels Setup:**

- `#general_announcements`  
- `#research_question_brainstorm`  
- `#resource_sharing`  
- `#daily_checkins`  
- `#random_watercooler`  

**Daily Check-in (via `#daily_checkins`):**

- What I did yesterday  
- What I’m working on today  
- Any blockers or help needed  

**Urgency Guidelines:**

- Use `@channel` **only** for time-sensitive, group-wide matters  
- Use `@[name]` for individual mentions  

### 🗂 Google Docs – Our Source of Truth

- Store all research notes, literature summaries, data links, and drafts here  
- Use “Suggesting” mode for edits  
- Keep folder shared with **full edit access** to all group members  

### 📞 Google Meet – Focused Discussions

- **1–2 meetings/week** for key discussions, decisions, and problem-solving  
- **Agenda required** (sent by the Facilitator 24 hours before)  
- **Active participation** expected from all  
- *Optional*: Record meetings (with consent) and share the link in Slack

## 3. Accountability & Progress Tracking

### 📊 Tracking Tools

Use **Google Sheets** or **Trello** to list:

- Tasks  
- Assigned person  
- Due dates  
- Status (e.g., “in progress”, “done”)  

### 🔄 Weekly Progress Updates

In each Google Meet, members will:

- Share what they’ve done  
- Flag challenges or blockers  
- Commit to next steps  

### 🚧 Handling Roadblocks

- **No-blame culture**: If you hit a delay, post on Slack right away  
- The group will help adjust tasks or offer support  

---

## 4. Getting Started & Keeping Momentum

### 🟢 Encouraging Engagement

- **Lead by example**: Be responsive on Slack and prepared for meetings  
- **Set expectations early**: Reiterate Slack reply norms and role responsibilities  
- **Start small**: Early tasks should be simple and clear  
  - *E.g.*, “Find 2 potential datasets” or “Summarize 1 article”  
- **Build rapport**: Begin meetings with a quick social check-in (5 min)  
- **Gentle nudges**: If someone’s inactive, the Facilitator may tag them on Slack or follow up privately (always respectfully)  
- **Feedback loop**: Periodically check in (Slack poll or quick chat) to adjust the plan or tools  

---

## ✅ Summary Checklist for Each Group Member

- ⏰ Check Slack daily (respond/react by 9 PM EST)  
- 📝 Post a short daily update in `#daily_checkins`  
- 📅 Attend weekly meetings and review the agenda in advance  
- ✍️ Use Google Docs in Suggesting mode  
- 📋 Track your assigned tasks in the shared tracker  
- 🚩 Communicate blockers early

With this plan, our group will stay **aligned, productive, and collaborative** as we move forward in forming our research question and beyond.
