  information gaps within the team.

## Start Doing

 discussions and task execution.

- Clearly defined roles and responsibilities lead to better accountability.  
- Completing tasks ahead of deadlines allows time for reviews,
  feedback, and revisions.  
- Retrospectives can be used to break down complex challenges,
giving everyone the opportunity to contribute, learn,
and gain confidence in solving similar problems in the future.
