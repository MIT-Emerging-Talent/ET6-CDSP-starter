# Team Retrospective – GreenFrontier

This retrospective captures our reflections on what worked, what didn’t,
and how we can move forward more effectively.
It’s an honest review to help us grow stronger as a team.

---

## 🛑 Stop Doing

- Procrastinating on tasks and leaving work until the last minute.
- Relying on unclear or infrequent communication. We need more consistent
and transparent updates from all members on Slack and GitHub.

---

## ✅ Continue Doing

- **Knowledge Sharing** – These were valuable opportunities to present
learnings, research, and solutions. We should continue allocating time for these.

---

## 🟢 Start Doing

- **Effective Onboarding** – Prepare pre-session materials so everyone
feels ready and aligned.
- **Task Division** – Clearly distribute tasks to ensure balanced workloads and accountability.
- **Defined Roles & Responsibilities** – Assign roles early in the process
to enable a structured and efficient workflow.
- **Set Expectations Early** – Agree on deliverables and working methods
from the start of each phase.

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- Strong communication is essential — our progress slows when it’s missing.
- Time management directly affects quality and team momentum.
- Role clarity and expectations should be defined early, not assumed.

---

## 📈 Plan vs. Reality

### ✅ What Went Well

- Peer support: Team members helped each other when stuck, showing
- collaboration potential.

### ❌ What Didn’t Go as Expected

- We underestimated the time needed to get familiar with the tools.
- Roles were not clearly assigned early, which caused confusion.
- Communication across Slack and GitHub was inconsistent and inefficient.

## 👤 Individual Retrospectives

> _Each member should reflect briefly on their contributions, challenges, and learnings._

### Mohamed Tilal

- **Contributions:**  

  hosting the Meetings and adding the agendas.

  Adding the norms, the main README, learning goals and the retrospective files.

- **Challenges:**  
  Lack of activit on slack caused that I didn't know what is best of the team.

  The team didn't start the work until the end of the milestone
   so I had some time problems.
- **What I Learned:**  
  I realized the importance of organizing our workflow more effectively and
  assigning tasks based on each member’s strengths and skills.
  A well-structured approach not only improves productivity but
  also helps everyone contribute where they can add the most value.
