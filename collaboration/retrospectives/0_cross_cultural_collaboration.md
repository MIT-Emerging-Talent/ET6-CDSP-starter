## Stop Doing

- Missing scheduled meetings or not notifying the team in advance.  
- Delaying responses to team inquiries or surveys which can block progress.  
- Assuming others will follow up. Everyone should take initiative when possible.
- Overlooking the importance of documenting small but important decisions.  
- Neglecting structured notetaking during meetings.  

## Continue Doing

- Using Zoom and digital tools (Slack and WhatsApp) to facilitate clear communication.
- Introducing team members and establishing familiarity early on.  
- Respectfully collaborating and sharing responsibilities.  
- Following planned workflows and rotating reviewer assignments.  
- Scheduling time based on availability to ensure participation and balance.  

## Start Doing

- Scheduling the next milestone meeting and setting a meeting agenda.  
- Fully utilizing GitHub Issues and the Project board to plan, assign,and track progress
- Documenting key decisions, responsibilities, and blockers during meetings.  
- Deleting outdated branches immediately after PR merges.  
- Syncing schedules and responsibilities early to reduce delays and miscommunication.

## Lessons Learned

- Creating multiple channels of communication (Slack, WhatsApp) helps maintain  
  quick and flexible contact.  
- Early introductions and role clarification create a solid foundation for teamwork.
- Transparent time availability helps manage expectations and plan around constraints.
- Structured task division improves clarity and accountability.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected

- Team members introduced themselves and established communication protocols.  
- Task division began early, creating momentum and direction.  
- Collaboration tools were set up proactively (Zoom, Slack, WhatsApp).  

### What parts of your plan did not work out

- Not all tasks were added to the project board during the initial planning phase.
- Meeting notes and responsibilities were not fully documented for future reference.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy

- Yes. WhatsApp was added alongside Slack for more casual or instant coordination.
- Time availability planning was added as part of the onboarding discussion.  

### Or remove extra steps

- Not applicable at this stage. Since this was our first meeting, the focus was
  on introductions and setup.  
- In future meetings, we aim to create a clear agenda to stay focused and  
  make the best use of everyone's time.

## Individual Retrospectives

### Alemayehu Desta

- Team members are supportive, and my first group experience helped me to easily
  be onboard for the data science collaboration project from early on.
- I found out my time zone is a little different than other members of the group,
  and I missed the first video meeting.
- I will proactively participate in the group meetings and continue to communicate
  using the communication channels the group has set up.  
- I will contact group members for any questions and help in times of need.

### Omnia

- Milestone went well overall thanks to a supportive team, with seamless  
  coordination on GitHub.  
- However, working asynchronously across different time zones made it challenging
  to agree on meeting times, and starting late led to rushing near the deadline.
- In the next milestone, I’ll aim to start earlier to allow smoother planning and
  avoid last-minute pressure.

### Razan Ibrahim

- This milestone deepened my understanding of collaboration and communication  
  within a cross-cultural team.  
- Coordinating meetings across different time zones was challenging, but by staying
  flexible and effectively using asynchronous communication, we stayed organized
  and achieved our goals.

### Jawid Mohseni

- During this milestone, I had a positive experience collaborating with my team.
- Everyone was supportive, and I felt encouraged to contribute ideas and ask  
  questions.  
- I made sure to ask for help from my team whenever I felt I needed it.  
- However, I faced some challenges with certain technical aspects of the project,
  particularly around using Git and resolving markdown CI errors.  
- To improve, I plan to review technical tasks more thoroughly and seek help sooner
  when I'm stuck.  
- I’ll also pay closer attention to formatting and CI guidelines before pushing any
  updates.

### Rumiya

- This milestone was a valuable learning experience for me, especially in  
  understanding how to collaborate effectively in a diverse, remote team  
  setting. I appreciated the supportive nature of our group, which made it  
  easier to contribute and learn from others.

- One challenge I faced was keeping up with tasks while balancing other  
  commitments, which sometimes affected my availability. Despite that, I  
  tried to stay engaged through asynchronous communication and made sure to  
  follow updates on GitHub and our group chat.

- For the next milestone, I aim to manage my time more effectively and  
  participate more actively in discussions and planning. I’m excited to  
  continue growing my skills and contributing to our shared goals.
