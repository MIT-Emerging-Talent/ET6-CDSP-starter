# Milestone 0: Cross-Cultural Collaboration

This part summarizes our teamâ€™s experience and reflections from
Milestone 0, focused on Cross-Cultural Collaboration. The primary goal of this milestone
was to establish the foundations for effective teamwork by exploring cross-cultural
communication, design thinking, and innovation methodologies.

During this phase (May 27 â€“ June 2), we got to know our teammates, defined our collaboration
strategy, and prepared our GitHub repository and shared documents. Below is our
collective reflection on what went well, what we can improve, and what weâ€™ve learned
from working together so far.

## ðŸ”´ Stop Doing

- Overthinking or overplanning that slows down actual work progress.
- Spending too much time on planning instead of taking action.
- Being inactive for long periods without informing the team in advance, which
can unintentionally disrupt collaboration.
  
## ðŸŸ¢ Continue Doing

- Communicating clearly and respectfully across time zones and cultures.
- Using collaborative tools like GitHub Projects and shared documents to stay organized.
- Using a shared space (like a Slack channel or Discord) for quick questions and
updates.
- Supporting each other in setting up the repository and assigning roles.
- Having open discussions for project process.

## ðŸŸ¡ Start Doing

- Establishing a regular check-in schedule to keep everyone aligned.
- Inform the group in advance if you expect to be unavailable or less responsive,
so the team can adjust plans accordingly.
- Adding brief summaries after each meeting to make sure weâ€™re all on the same page.

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons Learned

- Cross-cultural collaboration requires patience and active listening, especially
early on.
- Setting up solid foundations (norms, communication plans, etc.) helps avoid
misunderstandings later.
- Effective communication is essential for successful collaboration.
- Having structure (like milestones and a project board) from the beginning helps
reduce stress.

## ðŸ“Š Strategy vs. Board

1.What parts of our plan went as expected?

- We successfully met our group and set up the foundational structure of our project
repository on GitHub.
- We created and agreed upon key collaboration documents: group norms, communication
plan, constraints, and learning goals.
- The project board was organized with the required milestones and basic task cards,
as planned.
- Communication was open and respectful, enabling faster resolution of blockers.
- We maintained consistent stand-ups that helped sync progress and distribute
  tasks evenly as possible.

2.What parts of our plan did not work out?

- Coordinating schedules across time zones was more difficult than anticipated.
- Roles were not fully assigned effectively, and not every member was able to contribute
to the tasks due to other personal commitments.
- Some team members, including myself, struggled with balancing individual tasks
  with team support.

3.Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Yes, we needed to create a more detailed schedule that includes task assignments
 for each person and clear deadlines. This would help improve task ownership and
 keep everyone aligned.
  
4.Or remove extra steps?

- There weren't any extra steps.
