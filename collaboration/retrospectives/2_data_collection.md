# 🔄 Retrospective – Data Collection

"The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing."
— Henry Ford

## 🛑 Stop Doing

❌ Not making a clear plan: We did not establish a clear and specific plan of what type of data was needed before starting the research. This led to some sort of confusion among some team members.

🚫 Not sharing our new findings: We did not maintain sharing the datasets we found with each other during the initial search process.

## ✅ Continue Doing

🤝 Conducting short daily meetings: These daily meetings helped us stay aligned and be on the same page.

🔍 Documenting datasets individually: We kept documenting the sources of datasets and related information early, and we created a data dictionary for each dataset we planned to use, which helped us stay organized.

## 🌟 Start Doing

📝 Inspect datasets clearly: We need to closely look at the datasets we chose to use to ensure we are clearly aware of any possible flaws or problems that might be in the dataset.

🎯 Make a clear dataset searching plan: Making a plan, as specific as possible, of what type of datasets we need to look for on the internet and sharing it among team members at the beginning is going to reduce a lot of confusion.

👥 Role assigning strategy: Assigning clearer roles to each team member for each phase of the milestone, this way we can streamline the process and avoid duplication or missed steps.

## 📚 Lessons Learned

🔎 Inspect the data well before considering it as a valid option: we learned that some datasets might be good but have false or misleading values.

💬 Planning saves time: Starting with the data searching process with a clear plan shared among team members with different roles assigned reduces confusion and unnecessary effort.

🧠 Consider different types of data: we can still make use of data that is not in a CSV or Excel file format to support our research.

## ⚖️ Strategy vs. Reality

### ✅ What parts of your plan went as expected?

* We gathered war events data to correlate with the students' performance data.

* We were able to request data from the Islamic University of Gaza (IUG) about students' performance logs.

* We maintained good dataset documentation, which helped us stay organized.

### ❌ What parts of your plan did not work out?

* 🔇 We ended up not getting the students' performance data within the deadline.

* Gathering and cleaning the data within the deadline was a challenge; we were not able to clean all the datasets we found before the deadline.

## ➕ Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

* 🛠️ Yes, we decided to prioritize our data quality and our project over solely caring about the deadline, we believe in the direction of our project, and we believe that it could lead to really good and valuable results; the data we are waiting for
is worth being a little late.

* We are also considering finalizing our data preparation step within the upcoming milestone. Having all of the data we need together will help make our cleaning and preparation process more coherent.

### ➖ Or remove extra steps?

🗑️ No. No extra steps were removed.

## 👤 Individual Retrospectives

### Raneem Rami

In this milestone, I tried searching for useful datasets and started learning new things about how to work with data. I aim to keep improving and enhancing my knowledge about working with data.
