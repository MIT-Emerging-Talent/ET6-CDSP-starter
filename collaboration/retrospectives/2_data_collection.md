# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Digging endlessly for new data instead of working with what we already had.
 At some point, the search became a distraction.

## Continue Doing

- Keeping the research question front and center. It’s helped us filter what
 matters and what doesn’t.
- Holding sync meetings to follow our progress, discuss improvements,
 and plan next steps.
- Supporting each other across roles when things shift or someone’s stuck.
 That flexibility has been key.

## Start Doing

- Set up a shared weekly schedule or calendar to make coordination smoother,
 especially with the group merge

## Lessons learned

- Having a clear plan is great, but being willing to adapt it as we go is what
 actually keeps things moving.
- Good documentation isn’t extra work; it actually saves time when things get
 confusing or when we need to explain decisions later.
- Good collaboration is essential to make the work smoother and keep us focused
 on what matters.

## strategy vs Board

### what parts of your plan went as expected

- Successfully clarified the scope early, which helped reduce distraction later.

### What parts of your plan did not workout?

- Underestimated how messy real-world data would be, needed more time for cleaning
 and transformation.
- Coordination with the group members didn’t flow well, maybe we needed a shared
 calendar or clearer roles.

### Did you need to add things that weren’t in your strategy or remove extra steps

- Originally thought we’d rely only on one dataset, but ended up integrating two
 more to fill gaps.
- Added a “What do you get from the data? And be created for? Strategy” section to
 our data documentation. This helped us stay focused and intentional with each
  dataset, instead of analyzing blindly.

## Individual retrospectives

## Ahd

### What Went Well

- Found high-quality data on solar adoption and developed strategies that stay
 aligned with our core research question.

### What Didn’t Go as Planned

- Also, I probably spent too long in data search mode when I should’ve shifted to
 prep mode sooner.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy? Or remove extra steps?

- Mohamed Eltayeb lined up detailed agenda items on Issues, so I’m trading
  lengthy meeting minutes for a smarter checklist approach. less typing, more doing.

## Mohamed Eltayeb

### **What Went Well**

- Meetings were productive although usually not all team members were able to join.
We were able to get our hands on good data that covered different aspects
 (On grid, Off grid, and Imports)
- The merge with group 7 helped us with more team members as the work was beginning
 to become overwhelming.

### **What Didn’t Go as Planned**

- Some team members were unable to catch up with us due to some personal reasons.
We still haven't found enough specific data about conflicts and similar events yet.

### **Lessons Learned**

- Making detailed meeting agendas helps with making the most out of the meeting time.
Not to immerse ourselves in one aspect of the project (e.g. looking for data)
 and neglect the other aspects of the project.

## Zeinab

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- The merging process with Group 8 went smoothly. We worked together to catch up
 on what we had missed, and they were supportive in helping us become more
  familiar with their domain and research question.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- For several reasons, we were not able to continue working on our original
 research question. However, we hope to return to it and develop it further in
  the future.

### Did you need to add things not in your strategy?

- we can  organize additional practice sessions to support one another and become
 more familiar with the data analysis and ml
