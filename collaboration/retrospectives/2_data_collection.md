# Retrospective Milestone 2

## Progress and Process Improvement

This document summarizes the retrospective for Milestone 2. It highlights key learnings, challenges, and successes our
team experienced while advancing the project, incorporating a new team member, and refining our workflow and research focus.

Despite the busy period and evolving processes, our team remained committed and adaptable. This retrospective captures
what worked, what didn’t, and what we aim to improve moving forward.

---

## Stop Doing

- Expecting full engagement from all members during a busy season without considering realistic constraints.  
- Relying on asynchronous work without a clear structure and agreed-upon methods for tracking progress.  
- Insufficiently strict approach to documentation and centralized information storage, leading to loss of information.  
- Switching to a new platform (Slack → Git Discussions) without a clearly defined and tested process, causing confusion.

---

## Continue Doing

- Regularly providing follow-up updates after calls to keep the whole team informed of decisions and next steps.  
- Accompanying own actions with messages in team chats to maintain transparency and synchronization.  
- Being flexible in scheduling additional meetings as needed to address arising issues promptly (added +2 calls during
Milestone 2).  
- Maintaining a culture of mutual support where everyone is ready to back up teammates, help, and take on others’ tasks
if necessary.  

---

## Start Doing

- Introduce new project management and planning tools, such as MiroBoard, to improve task visualization and
retrospectives.  
- Organize and standardize the repository structure in advance to avoid confusion and ensure ease of teamwork.  
- Allocate time to prepare the workspace and agree on processes before starting next phases to minimize disruptions
caused by organizational changes.

## Lessons Learned

- Deeply diving into sub-questions of the main research question helped clarify the right perspectives and goals, based
on available data.  
- The addition of a new experienced member brought fresh insights and valuable expertise, positively impacting the team.
- Asynchronous work remains a challenge requiring further tuning and improvement of communication processes.  

---

## Strategy vs. Execution

- All main points of the plan were generally accomplished, helping maintain project structure and progress.  
- However, minor inaccuracies in the initial task documentation led to questions about priorities — specifically which
aspects to focus on (data collection, data cleaning, etc.).  
- Data collection for the main research question is ongoing, as the process proved to be more extensive and dynamic than
initially expected.
