# 🔄 Retrospective

This document reflects on our team’s experience  
during **Milestone 1_datasets (Data Collection)** of CDSP.  
It outlines what we should stop, continue, and start doing, lessons learned,  
and a comparison between our planned strategy and actual execution.

---

## 🛑 Stop Doing

- Underestimating task durations and not allocating buffer time  
- Relying too heavily on others instead of taking initiative  

---

## ✅ Continue Doing

- Holding regular team check-ins  
- Using Slack and WhatsApp for quick and efficient communication  
- Setting internal milestones to monitor progress  
- Maintaining a shared document for blockers and reflections  
- Collaborating with other groups to enhance project quality  
- Encouraging everyone to share their findings during team meetings  
- Starting work on each milestone early  

---

## 🆕 Start Doing

- Assigning reviewers at the beginning of each task  
- Taking ownership and actively supporting teammates  
  with research or technical challenges  
- Distributing data analysis responsibilities more evenly  

---

## 🎯 Strategy vs. Execution

### ✅ What went as planned?

- We held frequent and productive meetings  
- Every team member successfully contributed to data collection  
- We created organized files for various data types  
- Work was divided fairly and transparently among members  

### ❌ What didn’t go as planned?

- We initially approached data collection by focusing on a solution  
  and not the problem, which affected direction and focus

## 👤 Individual Retrospectives

### 🧠 Mukuna Kabeya

This milestone helped me grow in understanding how to
**identify relevant and reliable datasets** to support our research question on
blockchain-based identity and financial inclusion. I explored academic
and institutional sources related to refugee access to financial services
and blockchain-based ID systems.

I also contributed by organizing findings in our shared document
and reflecting on **data quality and completeness**. One key learning was
how difficult it can be to find disaggregated data specifically focused on
migrants and blockchain solutions. Going forward, I hope to support the team
in prioritizing which datasets are most usable for our analysis.

### 🧠 Hasan Zemzem

During this milestone, I focused on
**evaluating the relevance of potential data sources** to our research focus.
I helped assess whether a dataset could meaningfully contribute to answering
the question of whether blockchain-based identity and credit systems can
help address financial exclusion among migrants and refugees.

I also supported the team by reviewing sources to ensure they were credible
and covered both financial access and identity-related themes.
This experience taught me the importance of **framing clear criteria** for
dataset selection early in the process.

### 🧠 Özgür

In this milestone, I worked on
**searching for open-access datasets and reports** that addressed digital
identity systems, financial inclusion metrics, and blockchain initiatives in
humanitarian contexts. I collaborated with teammates to document metadata,
such as source credibility and dataset structure.

One challenge was filtering out sources that referenced blockchain broadly but
weren’t tied to financial access or refugee populations. This helped me better
understand how to align data collection tightly with research goals.

### 🧠 Mohammed Elfadil Rabie Hussien

My contribution was focused on **locating structured datasets** from NGOs, UN
agencies, and development organizations that addressed financial access
and refugee identity documentation. I helped compile and document datasets in
our shared workspace and raised questions about **data coverage and consistency**.

I also helped streamline collaboration by managing the way we labeled and
categorized sources. This experience highlighted how essential proper
data organization is for reducing confusion and avoiding duplication
before we begin analysis.

### 🧠 Mohammad Ziadah

This milestone gave me the opportunity to focus on
**source verification and dataset relevance**. I reviewed potential datasets
to determine if they were recent, reliable, and specific to refugees
or migrants. I also contributed by cross-checking our shared document
to remove overlaps and consolidate similar entries.

A challenge I faced was finding datasets that touched on both blockchain
identity solutions *and* financial inclusion, which taught me the value of
**interdisciplinary data collection** and staying flexible with keywords and sources.

### 🧠 Svitlana Musiienko

I focused on **refining and organizing collected data** to ensure it was ready
for the analysis phase in the next milestone. My role involved assessing
whether datasets were clean, whether any documentation was missing, and
whether the data was in a usable format (e.g., CSV, Excel).

Even though we did not begin analysis yet, this step taught me how important
**data readiness** is before any technical work begins. I also contributed to
noting possible gaps where more targeted data collection might
be needed in future milestones.
