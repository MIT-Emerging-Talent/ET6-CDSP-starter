# Milestone 2 Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Attending meetings without sufficient preparation.
- Relying solely on the first few search results without verifying the
reliability of sources.

---

## Continue Doing

- Continue applying systematic thinking through effective task division and
early internal deadlines for data exploration, documentation, and decision-making.
- Continue using Google Docs to document findings, track individual
contributions, and record source details (such as links, access dates, and
descriptions), while maintaining weekly structured check-ins to ensure team
alignment and avoid duplicated efforts.
- Supporting each other with GitHub setup and efficiently distributing tasks
among active team members.

---

## Start Doing

- Organizing the workflow and establishing a clear structure and vision for
each milestone from the beginning to avoid confusion later on.
- Improving asynchronous communication for better collaboration between meetings.
- Reaching out to domain experts to ensure the relevance and completeness of
the data.

---

## Lessons Learned

- Data collection requires more time than initially expected, especially when
dealing with multiple sources.
- Clear communication and early planning are crucial to preventing delays.
- Dataset availability should be considered early during the problem
identification and brainstorming phase.
- Having a well-defined cleaning protocol helps reduce redundant work and confusion.

---

## What Went as Expected

- The team collaborated effectively during weekly meetings, sharing multiple
potential datasets.
- We found a dataset containing relevant features that support our intended analysis.
- Team members effectively communicated about data issues and shared knowledge
during the cleaning phase.
- We were able to identify and clean key features needed for our analysis,
despite some complexity.

---

## What Didn’t Work

- There was a delay in making the final decision on which dataset to use and
the distribution of writing tasks.
- The structured approach to dataset selection didn’t work as expected at first
due to unclear criteria.
- Some data sources turned out to be unavailable, fake, or lacked credibility.
