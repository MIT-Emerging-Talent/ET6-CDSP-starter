# Project Retrospectives

This document captures our reflections at the end of each project milestone. It
is a living document that will be updated as the project progresses.

## **Milestone 2: Data Collection & Processing (Due June 30)**

### **Group Retrospective**

*(Note: This section is a collaborative summary of the team’s experience
during this milestone.)*

#### What Went Well

- **Successful Data Scraping:** We developed and ran scripts to collect a
substantial volume of data from multiple sources, including the Google Play Store,
Apple App Store, and Reddit.
- **Strong Technical Base:** We set up a flexible data processing pipeline capable
of handling diverse and inconsistent raw data, which prepares us well for the
upcoming analysis stage.
- **Clearer Project Scope:** The decision to split our analysis into “conversational”
vs. “baseline” apps has given the project a clear focus and will strengthen our
final insights.

#### What Could Have Gone Better

- **Coordination & Timing:** Synchronizing the delivery of raw data from everyone
was sometimes challenging and caused a few slowdowns.
- **Requirement Clarity:** Early on, there was some confusion about whether we
needed to pre-filter data by ratings, which highlighted the need for more specific
task definitions from the start.

#### What We’ll Do Differently for Milestone 3

- **Internal Checkpoints:** For the next milestone, we’ll set clearer interim
deadlines for smaller tasks to help avoid last-minute crunches.
- **Better Communication:** We’ll be more consistent about sharing updates and
blockers in our team channel to keep everyone on the same page and spot issues early.

## **Individual Retrospective: Sadam Husen**

### What I Contributed

- I helped build and run parts of the data pipeline, including scraping data for
the target apps to ensure we had good coverage even if other sources were delayed.
- I contributed to the main `preprocess_data.py` script, working on standardizing
raw files, cleaning inconsistencies, and combining them into the final datasets.
- I supported our data documentation by contributing notes on file structures and
processing steps.

#### What I Learned

- **Technical Skills:** I got more comfortable handling large, messy datasets
with Pandas, and learned practical ways to avoid common issues like duplicate
rows and mismatched columns.
- **Collaboration:** I learned the value of checking in regularly and clarifying
overlaps before taking on extra tasks, so everyone’s work stays aligned.
- **Communication:** I saw how clear documentation and quick updates can help the
whole team stay on track, especially when multiple people are working on related
scripts.

#### What I’m Focusing on Next

- For Milestone 3, I plan to stay actively involved in the data analysis phase and
help break down tasks so everyone can contribute meaningfully.
- I’ll keep sharing any blockers or ideas early, and help review each part of the
work to maintain clean, well-organized outputs.

## **Zizi**

### **Individual Retrospective – Milestone 2: Data Collection**

Aziz Azizi
Date: June 30, 2025

🔹 What Went Well (For Me Personally)

- Skill Growth: I improved my understanding of web scraping and worked hands-on
with tools like BeautifulSoup or Selenium which was new for me.

- Ownership: I took ownership of Replica and was able to
gather clean, well-structured data for the team to use **but my teammate did my
part without discussing it with me.**

- What Could Have Gone Better
  - Time Management: I underestimated how long some of the manual steps (e.g.,
  login-based scraping or data cleaning) would take, which delayed my deliverables
  slightly.

  - Task Clarity: A task I had already taken ownership of was later completed by
  someone else without team discussion. This led to some redundancy and
  frustration, and it highlighted the need for better respect for assigned
  responsibilities and clearer communication within the team.

## **Huda**

### Contribution

- I scraped raw data from Reddit about mental health apps and saved it as
`reddit_mental_health_apps_data__by_[HUDA].csv`.
- I then filtered posts related to Replika and saved them into
`replika_reddit_data__by_[HUDA].csv` for focused analysis.
- This work helps us explore how people talk about Replika beyond app reviews
and ratings.

#### What I Learned (personally)

- This was my first time scraping data from Reddit, so the whole process was
new to me.
- I learned how to collect user-generated content and structure it for analysis.
- I also saw the importance of clean file naming and documentation in teamwork.

#### What I’m Focusing on Next (personally)

- I’m focusing on learning and improving my data analysis skills to help analyze
the Reddit data more effectively.
- I plan to support the team by identifying patterns and contributing insights
during the next milestone.

## **Fevzi**

### Contribution (Fevzi)

- I created and maintained a separate repository:  
  [App Review Scraper](https://github.com/fevziismailsahin/app-review-scraper).

- Wrote Node.js scripts to scrape user reviews from the  
  [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com) and  
  [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com) using the RSS feed and  
  `google-play-scraper`.

- Merged the reviews from both platforms, removed duplicates by ID, and  
  exported the results in `.json` and `.csv` formats.

- Saved all collected data in the  
  [`data/`](https://github.com/fevziismailsahin/app-review-scraper/tree/main/data)  
  folder inside the repo.

- Organized the project with folders like  
  [`/scripts`](https://github.com/fevziismailsahin/app-review-scraper/tree/main/scripts)  
  and  
  [`.github/workflows`](https://github.com/fevziismailsahin/app-review-scraper/tree/main/.github/workflows)  
  to make it clean and reusable.

### What I Learned (Fevzi)

- Improved my skills in scraping, working with large datasets, and deduplication.

- Understood key differences between Apple and Google data formats and limitations.

- Learned to structure a project clearly for both local use and automation.

- Realized the value of consistency when collaborating with others.

### What’s Next

- Help with analyzing the collected reviews and comparing them with Reddit and  
  other sources.

- Identify patterns such as rating trends and user sentiment.

- Make the scraper easier to reuse for different apps and languages.

### Future Plan for the Repository

I am actively developing this repo into a public tool where **anyone can fetch app
review data**, apply **custom filters**, and **download it in various formats  
(JSON, CSV, etc.)** directly through a **web interface**.
