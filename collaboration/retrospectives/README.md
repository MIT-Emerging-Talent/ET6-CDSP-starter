# Retrospectives

> *‚ÄúWe do not learn from experience... we learn from reflecting on
> experience.‚Äù*

This folder contains our team‚Äôs retrospectives, written at the end of each milestone
to reflect on our progress, collaboration, and learning process.

Retrospectives are a critical part of our workflow. They allow us to step back,
evaluate what went well, what could be improved, and identify actionable lessons
that can strengthen our performance in the next phase. By documenting both individual
and collective insights, we aim to build a more adaptive, communicative, and
efficient team culture.
