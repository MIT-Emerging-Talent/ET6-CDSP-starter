# Milestone 1 Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Having team meetings without a clear agenda.  
- Letting meetings run longer than scheduled.  
- Spontaneous and unstructured brainstorming sessions.  
- Delaying decisions due to uncertainty or lack of consensus.  

## Continue Doing

- Showing up consistently to team check-ins twice a week.  
- Taking and sharing meeting notes to keep everyone aligned.  
- Communicating flexibly over WhatsApp to accommodate time zones and  
  availability.  
- Dividing responsibilities based on interest and availability.  
- Using shared Google Docs to track progress, thoughts, and research.  
- Voting when there are disagreements to keep moving forward.  

## Start Doing

- Planning the milestones more intentionally and ahead of time.  
- Applying system thinking and design thinking more purposefully to  
  structure brainstorming sessions.  
- Immediately documenting decisions made during meetings so everyone  
  stays updated.  

## Lessons Learned

- Aligning on a topic was harder than expected because of our different  
  academic and professional backgrounds.  
- Using the FRESCO framework helped us shape the research question and  
  assess its feasibility early.  
- Discussing data availability early on was important—it helped us  
  eliminate ideas that wouldn’t be doable in time.  

## What Went as Expected

- We finalized the milestone deliverables on time.  
- Every team member contributed meaningfully and met their responsibilities.  
- We managed to coordinate effectively across very different time zones.  

## What Didn’t Work

- Our goal to define a research question early in the milestone was too  
  optimistic.  
- The process of narrowing down the question was chaotic, with lots of  
  back-and-forth between different domains and ideas, and several  
  disagreements along the way due to our varied interests and priorities.
