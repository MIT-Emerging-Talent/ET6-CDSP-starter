# Milestone 1 Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Waiting until the last minute to begin deliverables.
- Delaying task distribution and leaving responsibilities unclear.
- Letting group coordination happen reactively instead of proactively.

## Continue Doing

- Sharing research resources with each other actively.
- Clearly stating what each member is working on.
- Having open communication about direction and ideas.
- Aligning early on a shared research focus.

## Start Doing

- Distributing tasks at the very beginning of the milestone cycle.
- Creating a shared task tracker so everyone knows their responsibilities.
- Scheduling regular check-ins to stay on track and avoid last-minute rush.
- Assigning clear leads for documentation, research, and code streams.

## Lessons Learned

We learned that good ideas alone aren't enough—timely execution matters too.
The biggest issue we faced was starting too late. This caused unnecessary
stress, especially during the project design phase, and reduced the quality of
our collaboration. We’ve agreed to change this by planning earlier, assigning
tasks upfront, and being more time-conscious as a team.

## Strategy vs. Reality

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- We successfully chose a strong, researchable question rooted in our
 interests and domain strengths.
- Our collaborative research—especially source sharing—worked well.
- The systems thinking framework helped us map the broader connections in our
 problem domain.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- We did not start early enough or assign work in a timely manner.
- Our documentation lagged behind and needed late-stage catch-up.
- Internal communication was inconsistent until the final days.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Yes. We added a last-minute effort to reorganize folders and files for
 clarity.
- We also created a detailed guide and added metadata to explain our domain
 study structure.

### Or remove extra steps?

- Some brainstorming threads were dropped as we narrowed our focus and
 finalized the main research question.

## Individual Retrospectives

**Name:**

### Madiha Malikzada
>
> I learned how important early planning and role clarity is in group research.
> We had a strong process and alignment, but since we didn’t begin task
> execution early enough, we faced time pressure at the end. For future
> milestones, I’ll make sure we distribute work earlier, communicate clearly,
> and review our timeline often to avoid the same issues.

### Noorelsalam Almakki

> I learned the value of adaptability and proactive communication.
> As our tasks evolved, I found that staying flexible and open to
> feedback helped us adjust quickly to challenges. One key takeaway
> for me is the importance of tracking both individual and group progress.
> In the upcoming milestones, I’ll aim to build stronger check-in routines
> ~and clarify interdependencies early to maintain better alignment and momentum.

### Dadi

> I realized the importance of precise scope management and timely task
> allocation in our research. Our team can improve more on applying systems
> thinking. We struggled with estimating the time needed for thorough analysis,
> leading to last-minute pressure. Moving forward, I’ll prioritize setting a
> narrower initial focus, establishing clear timelines, and incorporating buffer
> time to ensure smoother execution.

### Ahmed Khalifa

> Plan! plan! plan! That's the most important thing I learned. I also realized
> it’s more about how to search rather than just what to search, learning to~~~~~~~~~~
> search in a structured way helped a lot. I honestly had a lot of trouble adapting
> at first because all of this was new to me, but I slowly started to get the hang
> of it.

### Myat Charm

> During this research phase, I realized that I'm still uncertain about where my
> true interests lie, which made it harder for me to stay focused and motivated.
> I also struggled with time management and found it challenging to keep up with
> the pace set by my teammates. This experience showed me the importance of
> self-direction and better personal planning. Moving forward, I want to spend
> more time identifying my interests and developing habits that help me stay on
> track and contribute more consistently to the team.

### Al-hassen Sabeeh

> Jump into tasks immediately—action beats over planning. Require milestone kickoff
> meetings + deadline-driven micro-tasks. Iterate fast: ship early drafts and treat
> failures as data. *Progress > perfection!*
