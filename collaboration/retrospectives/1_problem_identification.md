# 🔄 Retrospective – Problem Identification

*"The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing."*  
*— Henry Ford*

## 🛑 Stop Doing

- ❌ **Rushing to Solutions Too Early:** At times, we began brainstorming solutions before clearly defining the problem. In the future, we must ensure the problem is fully understood and validated before moving forward.

- 🚫 **Vague Problem Statements:** Some initial problem definitions lacked specificity, which led to misalignment and confusion. We need to stop settling for general statements and work toward clear, actionable problem framing.

## ✅ Continue Doing

- 🔍 **User-Centered Discussions:** We consistently considered the needs and experiences of potential users while identifying problems. This helped guide us toward issues that are meaningful and impactful.

- 🤝 **Team Brainstorming Sessions:** Group discussions brought diverse perspectives to light and helped refine the problem space. Maintaining this collaborative thinking will be valuable in future phases too.

- 📚 **Background Research:** Reviewing literature, real-world examples, and existing solutions gave us context and helped in identifying gaps worth exploring.

## 🌟 Start Doing

- 📝 **Structured Problem Validation:** Before locking in a problem, we should gather feedback from potential users or stakeholders to ensure it’s relevant and solvable.

- 🎯 **Problem Scoping Frameworks:** Using structured tools (like “5 Whys,” root cause analysis, or problem trees) could help us better frame complex issues and avoid surface-level understanding.

- 🧭 **Alignment Checkpoints:** Introducing short checkpoints during team meetings to confirm everyone understands and agrees on the core problem will keep us better aligned.

- 👥 **Role Clarity in Research:** Assigning clearer roles in the research phase (e.g., interview lead, documenter, synthesizer) can streamline the process and avoid duplication or missed steps.

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- 🔎 **A well-defined problem is half the solution:** Spending more time on understanding and articulating the problem leads to better outcomes later.

- 💬 **Language matters:** How we phrase the problem directly affects the direction of our research and solution brainstorming. Being intentional with wording is critical.

- 🧠 **Diverse inputs strengthen clarity:** The more perspectives we bring in during this phase—whether from users, mentors, or teammates—the more grounded and relevant our problem definition becomes.

## ⚖️ Strategy vs. Reality

### ✅ What parts of your plan went as expected?

- ✅ We conducted initial research and used team ideation to narrow down from broad themes to one focused problem.  
- 📘 We documented our thinking process clearly, which will help us trace back decisions later in the project.  
- ✔️ Team discussions stayed constructive, and everyone was able to contribute ideas from their background and perspective.

### ❌ What parts of your plan did not work out?

- 🔇 We didn’t allocate enough time to validate the selected problem with external feedback. This may affect our confidence in its relevance moving forward.

### ➕ Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- 🛠️ Yes. Midway through, we realized we needed more structured research templates to guide our analysis and make sense of the secondary data we gathered.

### ➖ Or remove extra steps?

- 🗑️ No, but we did reduce time on competitive analysis to focus more on user-related insights.

## 👤 Individual Retrospectives

### Norbert Ndayisenga

During this milestone,  
I actively contributed to narrowing down the problem scope and drafting our core problem statement.
One of my challenges was balancing between exploring new ideas and staying focused on the problem at hand.
Through this process, I improved my skills in user-centered thinking and learned the importance of asking better, deeper questions.
I aim to bring this critical mindset into the solution ideation phase moving forward.

### Raneem Rami

In this milestone, I contributed to finding a problem in education. I did a lot of research and explored different ideas. In the next milestone, I aim to collaborate with my team members to find a suitable data set to answer our research question.
