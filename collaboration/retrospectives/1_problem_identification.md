# Team Retrospective

Over the past two weeks, our team focused on establishing group dynamics, aligning our goals, and initiating our research direction.

## Week 1

- We began by forming our group and establishing group structures and work plans.
- Some team members took initiative to create shared documents for:
  - Availability scheduling
  - Individual learning goals
  - Brainstorming research questions
  - Outlining constraints and risks
  - Choosing communication channels and project management tools

- Based on the collected availability, we scheduled our first team meeting.

### First Meeting Highlights

- Introductions and initial team bonding
- Overview and clarification of the project scope
- Review of shared project documents
- Brainstorming of potential research domains and questions
- We expressed strong interest in Mahdia’s proposed questions around **phishing and the structure of phishing attempts**, and decided to pursue that direction further
- The meeting was conducted via Slack Huddle and proved effective
- We assigned everyone a couple of days for individual research to assess:
  - Technical feasibility
  - Data availability
  - Timeline and scope
  - Relevance and social impact of the project

## Week 2

- We scheduled our second meeting to discuss findings and finalize the research question.

### Second Meeting Highlights

- Shared research outcomes and assessed feasibility of the proposed phishing-related research
- Refined and updated shared project documents
- Divided remaining tasks to meet the milestone requirements
- Revisited expectations: following Evan’s guidance, we agreed that **data acquisition** would not be our main concern at this stage; instead, our focus is to formulate a **socially beneficial and impactful research question**
- Agreed to remain flexible and iterate on the research question in later stages if needed

### Action Points

- Gave each team member one more day to complete individual tasks
- Final milestone deliverables will be pushed to GitHub by **end of day, 6/16**
- Addressed communication issues and introduced new engagement guidelines to ensure everyone stays involved

We feel we’ve built a strong foundation as a team, aligned on a promising research area, and are moving forward with clear next steps.
