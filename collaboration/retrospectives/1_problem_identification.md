# Milestone 1: Domain Study

**Milestone dates:** June 3 – June 16

---

## Main goal of Milestone 1

The main goal of this milestone was to brainstorm research ideas
using divergent thinking and select one using convergent thinking.
The goal was also to conduct a background study of our research domain
to understand what is already known and identify gaps worth exploring.
Finally, we set out to define a research question that meets
the FRESCO criteria: **Feasible, Relevant, Ethical, Specific, Complex, and Original.**

## 🔴 Stop Doing

- Being inactive for long periods without informing the team in advance, which  
  can unintentionally disrupt collaboration.  
- Accumulating work until near the deadline,
which increases stress and reduces quality.

---

## 🟢 Continue Doing

- Communicating clearly and respectfully across time zones and cultures.  
- Collaborating effectively through synchronous work, where team members worked
  on the same task at the same time professionally.  
- Maintaining strong commitment to meeting times, with all active members attending
  on time.

---

## 🟡 Start Doing

- Setting a meeting agenda in advance and making meetings more systematic
by discussing agenda items one by one,
ensuring a decision is made before moving on.  
- Adding brief summaries after each meeting to ensure everyone is on the same page,
  and creating a clear task list from what was agreed.

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

Sometimes what appears to be a difference of opinion
is caused by misunderstanding each other’s points,
when in fact we already agree. This can lead to wasting time  
discussing points we actually agree on.

## 📊 Strategy vs. Board

1️⃣ **What parts of our plan went as expected?**  

- Using divergent thinking and brainstorming to generate good research question ideas.
- Working synchronously, with team members collaborating on the same task at the
  same time professionally.

2️⃣ **What parts of our plan did not work out?**  

- Keeping a task list throughout the milestone for better task division.

3️⃣ **Did you need to add things that weren’t in your strategy?**  

- Setting clear criteria to review questions before reflecting on them.

4️⃣ **Or remove extra steps?**  

- No extra steps were removed.

## 👤 Individual Retrospectives

### Banu Ozyilmaz

> Contributions

- Took part in the domain search by exploring sources and suggesting topic ideas.
- Helped shape research directions through team meetings and brainstorming.
- Created and refined the content of the CONTRIBUTING.md file.
- Created a Git tag.
- Helped finalize the problem statement.

> Challenges  

- It was hard to narrow down broad topics into clear, focused areas
- Because of different time zones, it was hard to find enough shared meeting time.
This limited time made it harder to clarify small differences in ideas.
- Being part of this kind of process for the first time
made it hard for me to know where to start, which caused some confusion in the beginning.

> Progress

- Improved at moving from general themes to specific research questions.
- Learned to share early ideas to get quicker feedback.
- Became more mindful of how even small misunderstandings can hide agreement.
- Learned to apply divergent and convergent thinking more effectively.
- Learned to use the FRESCO framework to improve the quality of a research question.

### Ammar Ibrahim

> Contributions  

- Helped in writing the understanding of the problem by applying systems
thinking to the background resources, and by combining and summarizing the ideas.
- Helped in summarizing the problem statement to its final form.
- Wrote this retrospective file.

> Challenges  

- Balancing multiple responsibilities while meeting project deadlines.
- Following up on all the feedback and discussions across different platforms
(GitHub, Slack).

> Progress  

- Improved in applying systems thinking to structure and analyze complex problems.
- Became better at summarizing and refining collaborative work into clear, final
forms.
- Gained more confidence in dealing with GitHub workflows.

### Amro Mohamed

> Contributions  

- helped by (sharing personal experiences / asking questions / doing research)

> Progress  

- learned how policies, legal systems, and public beliefs are all connected

### Muhammad Shahroz

> Contributions  

- Tried to help refine the problem statement, but haven’t been
able to add much value yet.
- Shared some thoughts but didn’t contribute heavily in discussions or docs.

> Challenges  
>
- Struggled with managing time and learning the domain—all while dealing
with job work and timezone overlaps.
- Found it hard to stay up to date with feedback and next steps across
Slack and GitHub.

> Progress  

- Realized I need to focus on understanding the project before
I can contribute more meaningfully.
