# 🔄 Retrospective

*"The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing."*  
*— Henry Ford*

## 🛑 Stop Doing

- ❌ **Lack of Active Participation:** A few teammates couldn’t consistently  
  contribute due to personal issues, which slowed the group down. In the  
  future, it’s important to be upfront about our availability to plan better.

- 🚫 **Underestimating the Importance of the Project Board:** We didn’t fully  
  leverage the GitHub project board in the beginning. This caused some  
  confusion about which tasks were pending or ready for review.

## ✅ Continue Doing

- 🤝 **Collaboration and Flexibility:** Team members were quick to help each  
  other—whether troubleshooting issues with GitHub or Python, or creating  
  extra solutions for others to review. Keeping this cooperative attitude  
  will help us succeed as we continue the program.

- 🔍 **Regular code reviews using GitHub:** We now recognize the value of using
   GitHub to communicate about code. Everyone is working on improving this  
  skill to manage code more effectively.

- 🗓️ **Regular Check-ins:** Our meetings helped maintain clarity and kept  
  everyone aligned, even during times of delay or uncertainty.

## 🌟 Start Doing

- ⏰ **Deadlines, deadlines, deadlines:** We lacked a timeline for specific  
  tasks, which led to unnecessary time pressure. Setting clear deadlines in  
  the future will help avoid this and allow room to fix any late-stage issues.

- 🏷️ **Organized Project Board and Label Usage:** We need to make better use of
 the GitHub project board and labels for clearer task tracking. We also  
  need to be more descriptive in pull request and issue summaries—even if  
  the tasks seem simple.

- 👥 **Clearer Role Definition:** Everyone should have a defined role from the  
  start to prevent confusion and ensure balanced contribution across the  
  team.

- 💬 **Capabilities Discussion:** Rather than just saying “I’m a beginner,” we  
  should have deeper conversations about each member’s familiarity with the  
  tools. This way, we can offer support early on where needed.

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- 🤝 **Collaboration, collaboration, collaboration:** Working well as a team  
  ensures both high-quality outcomes and fair workload distribution.  
  Everyone benefits when the group supports one another.

- 🌐 **Marketing on GitHub:** Since GitHub is widely used by developers and  
  employers, it's smart to build and share our projects there. Later,  
  contributing to open-source projects will be a powerful way to grow.

- 🧠 **Reviews and feedback:** Don't assume others will understand your code  
  just because you do. Receiving peer feedback is essential for clarity,  
  improvement, and learning. **In short: Code reviews are non-negotiable!**

## ⚖️ Strategy vs. Board

### ✅ What parts of your plan went as expected?

- ✅ All solutions and reviews were submitted on time, which avoided last-  
  minute issues.  
- 📘 Everyone picked up foundational Git and GitHub skills, along with an  
  introduction to testing and review workflows.  
- ✔️ Most team members didn’t need to change their plans—just focus on  
  executing them better.

### ❌ What parts of your plan did not work out?

- 🔇 Communication was a weak point. While the project was delivered  
  successfully, better interaction and updates would’ve improved the  
  experience.

### ➕ Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- 🛠️ Yes. Some team members faced challenges learning Git and GitHub, so we  
  arranged additional support meetings to fill in the gaps.

### ➖ Or remove extra steps?

- 🗑️ No unnecessary steps had to be removed from our strategy.

## 👤 Individual Retrospectives

### Wuor Bhang

During this milestone,

I actively contributed to code development, GitHub task
 coordination, and peer support. My key challenge was ensuring all team members
  stayed aligned on the workflow, especially when managing Git conflicts.
   I’ve grown in my ability to coordinate tasks, support others with Git, and write
clearer, documented code. I look forward to bringing more structure and technical
leadership to future milestones.

### Norbert Ndayisenga

I contributed by reviewing teammates’ solutions, attending meetings, and  
helping others navigate GitHub. One challenge I faced was balancing my  
availability with project deadlines, but team support helped me stay on  
track. I learned the importance of consistent communication and documenting  
clearly in pull requests. This milestone gave me a solid introduction to  
team collaboration in a developer workflow, and I look forward to applying  
these lessons in the next phase.
