# Learning Goals

## Collective

### 1. identify data structures and trends

* Identify foundational data structures and trends to solidify our understanding
of the data
* Document insights to ensure a well-rounded understanding of target
to implement solutions to data problems.

### 2. Learn and Explore New problem-solving Concepts

* Experiment with advanced algorithms and cutting-edge techniques to get
data-driven solutions.
* Apply new tools, libraries, and features in our programming environment  to
broaden our technical expertise.

### 3. Ensure Code Quality

* Strive for clean, well-documented, and maintainable code in notebooks and scripts.
* ensure data cleanliness and quality before applying any algorithms for
optimal results.
* Emphasize readability and scalability to ensure long-term success.

### 4. Provide comprehensive result interpretation

* Thoroughly interpret results of data analysis and optimize data-driven decision-making.

### 5.  Engage in periodic Code Reviews

* Participate in constructive feedback cycles to refine both code and
analytical approaches.
* Learn from each other’s strengths while identifying areas for growth.

### 6. Develop End-to-End Data Science Workflow Proficiency

* Gain hands-on experience across the full lifecycle of a data science
 project from data acquisition and preparation to modeling, evaluation, and communication.

### 7. Domain of interest

* In this data science project, we are interested in the field of education, with a primary focus on online learning in war-affected regions.
* We aim to investigate how the harsh conditions that students live in war-affected countries affect their participation and engagement in online learning, and how AI can help improve their performance.
