# Learning Goals

This file outlines our shared and individual learning goals for this
 collaborative data science project. By understanding each otherâ€™s motivations,
  we aim to support one another and make our teamwork more effective.

## ðŸ§  Group Learning Objectives

- Effective Team Collaboration â€“ Ensure smooth communication, task distribution,
 and problem-solving within the team.
- Version Control with Git â€“ Maintain well-structured repositories, track changes,
and ensure seamless code integration.
- Code Review & Peer Feedback â€“ Implement structured review processes to improve
 code quality and knowledge sharing.
- Conflict Resolution in Git â€“ Learn best practices for handling merge conflicts
 and maintaining repository integrity.
- Documentation & Transparency â€“ Keep clear records of decisions, changes, and
 workflow to ensure everyone stays aligned.
- Strengthen our understanding of data science concepts and workflows.
- Practice using data structures and algorithms in data science tasks.
- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.
- Strengthen our collaboration muscle.
- Respect deadlines while remaining flexible and empathetic.
- Approach datasets not just as numbers, but as stories waiting to be uncovered.
