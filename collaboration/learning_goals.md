# Learning Goals

This file is a shared space for the team to write down our learning objectives for
these exercises.

Since we're just getting started, we haven’t finalized all our goals yet. This
document will evolve as we progress through the project.

## Example Goals

- Goal 1
- Goal 2

## Notes

Each team member can edit and add their individual goals here. It's okay if we all
have different focuses — what's important is that we stay aligned on expectations.

Feel free to update this file at any time as your learning objectives grow or shift.
