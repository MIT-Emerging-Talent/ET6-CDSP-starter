## Communication Channels

How often will we get in touch on each channel, and what we will discuss there:

- **Issues and Pull Requests**: Used for task-specific discussions and reviewing submitted code. Helps in learning how to manage GitHub collaboration. We should establish clear norms on when to close issues and accept PRs.
- **Slack**: Preferred for daily communication, quick questions, and coordination.
- **Video Calls**: Held on Google Meet. Used for meetings. Weekly or as needed.

## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and stubbornly getting nowhere. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 → 30 min_: Try on your own  
2. _30 → 60 min_: Ask your group for help  
3. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub
