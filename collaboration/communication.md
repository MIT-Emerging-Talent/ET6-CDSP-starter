## Communication Channels 🗣️

how often will we get in touch on each channel, and what we will discuss there:

- **Issues** 🧑‍💻
  - Use issues to track tasks and share updates on progress.
  - Provide clear, actionable comments when discussing challenges or asking for clarification.
- **Pull Requests** 🧑‍💻
  - Once we finish our assigned tasks, we’ll open a pull request.
This is where we review each other’s code to catch any mistakes,
suggest improvements, and make sure everything works properly before merging
into the main branch.
- **Slack/Discord** 🧑‍💻
  - Slack channel will be our group’s primary communication channel.
It will be used to share announcements, updates and regular group project
related communication.

## Asking for Help 🤝

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and
stubbornly getting no where. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 -> 30 min_: Try on your own
1. _30 -> 60 min_: Ask your group for help
1. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub
