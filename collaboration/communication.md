## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes and
stubbornly getting nowhere. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 ‚Üí 30 min_: Try to solve the problem on your own.
2. _30 ‚Üí 60 min_: Ask your team members for help.
3. _60+ min_: Reach out to a coach on Slack or GitHub.
