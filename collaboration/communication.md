# Communication Guideline

## Message Response

While we understand that team members may not be available to check messages constantly,
we agree to check Slack at least once daily by 9:00 PM EST and acknowledge all
messages in a timely and respectful manner.

## Discussion Transparency

Any meetings or agreements discussed outside the Slack channel must be shared
on the dedicated Slack channel
so that all team members stay informed and aligned.

## Meeting Protocol

Agendas must be shared on Slack prior to the meeting.

After each meeting, a summary of action points should be posted on Slack, along
with a recording, whenever possible.

## Communication

Our meeting schedule will be based on:

- Project progress  
- The need for clarification or alignment  
- Team availability  

Meetings should be proposed at least 24 hours in advance on Slack, except in
urgent situations such as last-minute conflicts or missed deliverables.

## Communication Channels

Slack: Our main communication platform. Please ensure all plans  
or updates discussed elsewhere are forwarded to the group.

Google Meet: Preferred for meetings due to its reliable recording feature.

Zoom or Slack Huddles may be used optionally when needed.

GitHub: Used for task tracking. Please create issues for assigned tasks  
and update the project board regularly.

## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes and  
stubbornly getting nowhere. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help  
based on how long youâ€™ve been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 â†’ 30 min_: Try on your own  
2. _30 â†’ 60 min_: Ask your group for help  
3. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack, WhatsApp or GitHub
