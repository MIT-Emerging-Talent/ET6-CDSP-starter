## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes,
and stubbornly getting nowhere.
Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 → 30 min_: Try on your own  
2. _30 → 60 min_: Ask your group for help  
3. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub
