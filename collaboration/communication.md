## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and
stubbornly getting nowhere. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. **0 -> 30 min**: Try on your own.
2. **30 -> 60 min**: Ask your group for help.
3. **60+ min**: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub.
