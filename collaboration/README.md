# Group Norms

We are committed to creating a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative
environment grounded in trust, clear communication, and shared accountability.
We value empathy, openness, and adaptability as we strive to grow and succeed
together.

1. **We prioritize trust.**  
   We aim to build both cognitive and affective trust by being reliable,
   empathetic, and honest in our interactions.

2. **We communicate with clarity and care.**  
   Whether asynchronously via Slack and GitHub or in real-time through Google
   Meet, we engage thoughtfully and respectfully.

3. **We value open expression.**  
   Everyone is encouraged to share ideas and opinions, knowing they will be
   heard and respected without judgment.

4. **We address conflicts constructively.**  
   When trust is damaged, we commit to open discussion, sincere apology,
   and collaborative resolution.

5. **We respect time and effort.**  
   We agree to set clear meeting agendas, be punctual, and remain flexible to
   accommodate each otherâ€™s circumstances.

6. **We balance discussion and debate.**  
   We use discussion to explore ideas and debate to drive decisions,
   recognizing when each is appropriate.

7. **We foster a culture of feedback.**  
   Constructive feedback is welcomed and given with the intent to support
   growth, not to criticize.

8. **We acknowledge and adapt to different working styles.**  
   We recognize that our strengths and approaches vary, and we remain open and
   adaptive in our collaboration.
