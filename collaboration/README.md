## ðŸ”· Supporting Details and Clarifications

### **Building Cognitive and Affective Trust**

- We already have some cognitive trust from group chats and Slack.  
- To build **affective trust** (trust based on shared experiences):  
  - **Do what you say youâ€™ll do** â€” if you said youâ€™d handle part  
    of the project, follow through.  
  - If you canâ€™t meet a commitment for a genuine reason, let the  
    group know. Repeated issues can hurt trust.  
  - Being late to meetings or not respecting othersâ€™ time can  
    damage team trust.

---

### **What if Trust is Damaged?**

- We agree to **talk openly** if trust breaks.  
- Communication is key to rebuilding trust.  
- Both parties should be willing to **work on the issue** â€” ignoring  
  it makes trust hard to repair.  
- If someone canâ€™t meet a deadline or attend a meeting, they should  
  be **honest and proactive** about it.  

---

### **Balancing Discussion and Debate**

- **Discussion** is good for exploring problems and generating ideas.  
- **Debate** helps decide which idea is best.  
- Weâ€™ll keep debates **constructive** and **focused on ideas, not people**.  
- **Respectful disagreement** means giving reasons, not dismissing  
  someone outright.  

---

### **Handling Meeting Times and Agendas**

- Weâ€™ve already checked availability in breakout rooms.  
- Weâ€™ll **continue to confirm times that work for everyone**.  
- Agendas will be shared **before** each meeting to keep us focused.

---

### **Communication About the Project**

- Primary communication channels: **Zoom meetings** and **GitHub comments**.  
- Weâ€™ll **use GitHub first** for tasks and problem-solving.  
- If something is too big for GitHub, weâ€™ll move to **Slack**.  
- For urgent issues, weâ€™ll **schedule a Zoom meeting** to sort them out.

---

### **Feeling Respected or Disrespected**

- Feeling respected means having your ideas **listened to and considered  
  fairly**.  
- If someone disagrees, theyâ€™ll **explain why** rather than dismiss  
  an idea outright.  
- **Talking over people** in meetings is disrespectful.  
- Everyone deserves time to speak.  
- **Criticism** should be about **the work, not the person**.
