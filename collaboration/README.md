## Group Norms

1. **Trust and Communication**
   - We commit to both cognitive trust (trusting in each other’s skills) and affective trust (trusting in each other’s          intentions).
   - We will communicate openly, honestly, and respectfully—without assumptions.
   - We’ll start meetings with brief check-ins to stay connected.

2. **When Trust Breaks Down**  
   - We will acknowledge broken trust, not ignore it.
   - We’ll discuss challenges transparently and respectfully, aiming to resolve issues quickly.
   -  We're willing to engage in one-on-one or group conversations to rebuild trust.

3. **Discussion/Debate**  
   - We value constructive disagreement as a way to reach stronger outcomes—not to “win.”
   - We’ll separate discussion time from debate time and keep it focused.
   - Everyone’s input deserves to be heard with supporting data and without bias.

4. **Meetings & Time Management**  
   - Meetings will be held between 12pm–4pm EST, at times agreed upon using polls.
   - All meetings will have a clear agenda (shared 24 hours in advance), start on time, and end with action steps.
   - We’ll rotate facilitators to share leadership.

5. **Respect in Action**  
   -  We respect each other by listening fully and engaging thoughtfully with each other’s ideas.
   -  No interruptions during presentations.
   -  Notify the team in advance if you’ll miss a meeting.
   -  Everyone’s contributions—big or small—are acknowledged and appreciated.
