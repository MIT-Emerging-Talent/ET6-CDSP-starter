# ü§ù Group 12 Collaborative Project

Welcome to our group project repository! Below you'll find our **group norms**,
which we‚Äôve intentionally crafted to support healthy, effective, and inclusive collaboration.

This is a **living document**‚Äîplease revisit and revise it as our group evolves.

## üîπ Group Norm Summary

Our group is built on **trust**, **open communication**, and **mutual respect**.
We strive to create a **flexible**, **inclusive**, and **supportive** environment,
 where all voices are valued and decisions are made collaboratively.

## üß≠ Our Norms

1. **We aim to build a foundation of trust** through consistent communication and
mutual respect‚Äîbalancing both cognitive (reliability, preparedness) and affective
(empathy, connection) trust.

2. **We commit to addressing breakdowns in trust** directly and with empathy,
using structured dialogue, space for explanation, and visible efforts toward repair.

3. **We encourage open discussion and constructive debate** to reach shared
understanding and informed decisions‚Äîfocusing on ideas, not individuals, and
allowing respectful disagreement.

4. **We respect each other‚Äôs time** in both meetings and asynchronous
communication. Meetings are scheduled in advance, start and end on time, and
have shared agendas.

5. **We use intentional communication tools**: Slack or WhatsApp for quick updates,
shared drives for documents, and meetings for critical decisions. Expectations
around availability will be made clear.

6. **We recognize and value every team member‚Äôs voice, time, and contributions**,
ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to participate and lead.

7. **We are open to revisiting and refining our group norms** as our needs, dynamics,
or project goals change.

8. **We strive to share responsibilities fairly**,
offer support during challenges, and practice compassion and flexibility when
stress levels rise.

9. **We make decisions collaboratively and transparently**,
documenting outcomes and allowing space for dissenting opinions to be voiced and
respected.
