# 🌍 Cross-Cultural Group Norms

## Intention-Based Norms

1. **We build and maintain trust**  
   We value both competence and empathy, recognizing that both cognitive and affective trust are essential for our collaboration.  
   We understand that we all are learners and errors might happen from time to time that might affect the group. In case this happens, we notify the group at the earliest possible occurrence.  
   We keep an open mind and help each other learn and grow, even when the outcome doesn't directly affect us.  
   To increase trust, we refrain from speaking negatively about team members with the intent to harm. Instead, we communicate our feelings openly and in a constructive way.  
   We do our best to deliver high-quality work consistently.  
   While we understand other commitments exist, we avoid "ghosting" team members—especially when they are expecting deliverables.

2. **We respect time**  
   We are mindful of each other’s schedules and communicate promptly when plans shift.

3. **We prioritize open, honest communication**  
   We embrace diverse communication styles without judgment and make space for all voices.

4. **We view disagreement as an opportunity to learn**  
   We distinguish between discussion and debate and choose the most appropriate format for each context.  
   At the beginning of projects or when brainstorming, we prioritize discussion to explore ideas. For evaluating and making decisions, we use structured debate.  
   We argue the subject matter—not the person—and do not use harsh language or insults. Respectful disagreement is essential.

5. **We support accountability**  
   We set clear expectations and address misunderstandings constructively and respectfully.

6. **We value inclusion and psychological safety**  
   We ensure all members feel heard, respected, and safe to express themselves.

7. **We adapt and evolve our norms**  
   We revisit our norms regularly and revise them to reflect team growth and changes.

8. **We clarify communication channels**  
   We agree on where and how to communicate about urgent tasks, reflections, and logistics.  

   For our group communication purposes:
   - Meetings should be discussed and arranged on the dedicated Slack channel: `#et6_cdsp_group_14`.
   - Agenda and Zoom/Google Meet links should be shared in the Slack channel in advance by the person calling the meeting or as agreed upon by the team.
   - Meeting frequency should be decided as needed and scheduled at least 24 hours in advance, unless it’s an emergency.
   - Action points from meetings should be shared by one attendee in the Slack channel and optionally uploaded to the group GitHub repo.
   - We understand that everyone has external commitments; however, when we can't meet a deadline or attend a meeting, we notify the team in the Slack group channel as early as possible.

9. **We assume good intent**  
   We approach mistakes and unmet expectations with empathy, dialogue, and a willingness to understand.

10. **We share leadership**  
   We distribute roles and responsibilities based on strengths and availability.
