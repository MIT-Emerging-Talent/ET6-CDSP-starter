# Collaboration

This folder contains key documents that support our team's collaboration, planning,
and continuous improvement. Each file is designed to help us stay aligned, communicate
effectively, and reflect on our progress throughout the project. It also includes
the shared group norms that guide how we work together as a team.

## Files Included 🗃️

- [**README.md**](README.md)  
  Contains an introduction of the collaboration process and group norms.

- [**communication.md**](communication.md)  
  Details how and when we communicate, including preferred channels, weekly check-ins,
  availability, and when to ask for help.

- [**constraints.md**](constraints.md)  
  Lists any known limitations such as deadlines, availability, scope boundaries,
  or technical issues.

- [**learning_goals.md**](learning_goals.md)  
  Defines what each team member hopes to learn during the project, both technically

- [**retrospectives**](retrospectives/)  
  A folder for team reflections at several points in the project, such as what went

Keeping these documents up to date helps us stay transparent, focused, goal-oriented,
and flexible as the project evolves. 🚀

## Group Norms 📜

To support the documents above and ensure smooth teamwork, we have established
a set of shared norms. These norms guide how we collaborate each day by encouraging
clear communication, mutual respect, and shared ownership. They help us navigate
challenges, stay on track, and create a supportive environment where everyone
can do their best work.

### 1. Respectful Communication 🤝

We actively listen to each other, value all contributions, and speak respectfully
at all times.

### 2. Equal Participation ⚖️

Everyone is expected to contribute equally to discussions, code, and documentation
unless otherwise agreed upon.

### 3. Clear and Timely Communication ⏰

We use our group chat, video meetings and GitHub issues to keep each other informed.
If someone will be unavailable, they inform the team in advance.

### 4. Commitment to Deadlines 📅

We agree on realistic deadlines and take responsibility for meeting them.
We support each other when someone falls behind.

### 5. Constructive Feedback 💬

We give and receive feedback with the goal of improving our work, not criticizing
individuals.

### 6. Decision Making by Consensus 🧠

Major decisions are made as a group, and everyone’s voice is heard before reaching
agreement.

### 7. Use of GitHub 🔀

All code is pushed to GitHub with meaningful commit messages.  
Pull requests are used for all major changes and must be reviewed by at least
two team member.  
We also use GitHub Project Boards to organize tasks, track
progress, and ensure transparency. Each task is represented as a card and moves
through stages like _To Do, In Progress,_ and _Done_. Team members are responsible
for updating the status of their tasks regularly.

### 8. Code Quality and Documentation 🧑‍💻

We follow agreed coding conventions and document our work clearly so others can
understand and build on it.

### 9. Problem Solving Together 🤔

We discuss blockers or confusion openly and help each other resolve problems.

### 10. Accountability and Ownership 🙋

Each member is responsible for their tasks and follows through on commitments.
If issues arise, we communicate honestly and seek support.
