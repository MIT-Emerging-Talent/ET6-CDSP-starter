# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

- Meet deadlines for each milestone  
- Use only **Python**  
- **Slack** is the main communication messenger  

## Internal: Involuntary

- Team members come from diverse academic and professional backgrounds, which may
  result in different perspectives and approaches to problem-solving.  

- Due to other commitments, team members have limited availability.  

- Communication may be asynchronous due to time zone differences, potentially
  leading to delays in responses and coordination.  

## Internal: Voluntary

- Pull requests will be merged with at least **one approval**  

- We will have **one group call per week**  

- At least **two team members attend the weekly CDSP sessions** and update the
  other members  

- Provide **constructive and clear feedback** during code reviews, especially if
  you have questions or suggestions for improvement
