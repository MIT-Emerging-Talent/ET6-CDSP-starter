# ðŸ“Œ Project Constraints

These are the boundaries that shape and guide our work. They fall into three
categories: external (outside our control), internal involuntary (within the
team but not chosen), and internal voluntary (team-defined guidelines).
  
## ðŸ”’ External Constraints  

*Factors outside the teamâ€™s control that must be respected.*

- **Project Deadlines**: Must meet non-negotiable deadlines set by clients or
  stakeholders.  
- **Unit Test Requirements**: A minimum number of unit tests must pass before
  code can be merged.  
- **Technology Mandates**: Required use of specific tools, frameworks, or
  platforms as directed by the client or sponsor.  
- **Power and Connectivity**: Disruptions to electricity or internet may affect
  productivity but are out of scope to manage.  
- **Legal & Regulatory Compliance**: Adherence to all relevant laws, standards,
  or data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).  
- **Third-Party Services**: Dependencies on external APIs or services come with
  limitations like rate caps or downtime.
  
## ðŸ§­ Internal Constraints: Involuntary  

*Constraints within the team that are not the result of deliberate decisions.*

- **Team Skill Levels**: Varying expertise across the team affects task
  assignments and timelines.  
- **Time Availability**: Members have limited hours due to other responsibilities
  or part-time status.  
- **Hardware & Tools**: Limited access to required hardware, testing devices, or
  licensed software.  
- **Domain Knowledge**: Gaps in familiarity with the projectâ€™s industry or
  content can slow down certain phases.
 
## âœ… Internal Constraints: Voluntary  

*Agreed-upon decisions made to improve workflow, maintain quality, and scope
the project effectively.*

- **Coding Standards**: All developers follow shared formatting and best
  practices for readability and consistency.  
- **Code Review Checklist**: Merges are subject to a checklist that includes
  testing, documentation, and style compliance.  
- **Working Hours**: A sustainable weekly time commitment is agreed upon for
  balanced contributions.  
- **Color Palette**: The UI will be kept in black and white for minimalist
  consistency.  
- **Feature Prioritization**: Core features are implemented first; enhancements
  are deferred to later phases.  
- **Communication Protocols**: Team uses defined channels (e.g., Slack, Notion,
  Email) to share updates and collaborate.  
- **Version Control Workflow**: Git is used with clear practicesâ€”feature
  branching, pull requests, and regular commits.
