<!-- Project constraints we will adhere to in this project -->

# Project Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External Constraints

### 1. Time Zone Differences

**Impact**: Difficulty scheduling live meetings and coordinating work across
 different time zones.
**Mitigation**: Use flexible meeting times,
asynchronous communication tools
(e.g., Slack, email), and record meetings
for those who cannot attend live.

### 2. Family Responsibilities

**Impact**: Unpredictable availability due
to personal or family commitments.  
**Mitigation**: Allow flexible deadlines and
 encourage early communication about availability
 changes.

### 3. Work Obligations

**Impact**: Conflict between project work and full-time job responsibilities.  
**Mitigation**: Prioritize tasks, break
 work into manageable parts, and distribute
  workload fairly.

### 4. Studying for Exams

**Impact**: Reduced participation during exam periods.  
**Mitigation**: Adjust project timelines to accommodate exam schedules.

### 5. Limited Internet Access

**Impact**: Difficulty accessing resources
 and participating in live online
  meetings due to poor or unstable
   internet connection.  
**Mitigation**: Provide downloadable project
 materials ahead of time;
  use alternative communication methods
   (e.g., phone, chat apps); record all
    meetings so members can watch them
     later when they have better access.

### 6. Device Issues

**Impact**: Delays or interruptions caused by hardware or software problems.  
**Mitigation**: Encourage regular backups,
 provide basic technical support
  guidelines, and have contingency plans.

## Internal Constraints: Involuntary

### 1. Stress from Balancing Multiple Responsibilities

**Impact**: Reduced productivity and
 risk of burnout.  
**Mitigation**: Promote time management
 best practices, encourage breaks,
  and facilitate peer support.

### 2. Tendency to Take Over Leadership

**Impact**: May cause frustration among team members.  
**Mitigation**: Define clear roles,
 encourage open feedback, and establish
  communication norms.

### 3. Lack of Coding Experience

**Impact**: Delays in completing technical tasks.  
**Mitigation**: Provide learning resources
 and mentorship, assign tasks according
  to skill levels, and encourage members
   to seek help from those with coding experience.

## Summary

Documenting constraints alongside clear mitigation strategies increases transparency,
 reduces risks, and helps manage
  time and resources efficiently.
   It supports team satisfaction and
    fosters collaboration, improving
     the chances of project success.
