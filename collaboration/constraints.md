# 🚧 Project Constraints – CSDP Team 15

**Boundaries of This Project**  
This project will be guided by the domain, scope, and goals defined in our  
group work. It is shaped by external requirements from the MIT Emerging  
Talent program (including milestone deadlines), and internal decisions we've  
made as a team about time, skills, and project direction. These boundaries  
help us stay focused, manage expectations, and collaborate effectively. We  
will revisit these boundaries if project direction or external expectations  
change.

*Updated per Milestone 0 syllabus guidelines for cross-cultural  
collaboration and constraint definition.*

  - M3: Jul 21 • M4: Aug 11 • M5: Aug 25
- **Platform Requirements**:
  - GitHub for all code/documentation
  - Google Colab for cloud-based analysis
- **Workshop Attendance**: Minimum 2 members present at each workshop
- **Time Commitment**: 8+ hours/week per member:
  - 1.5h workshops • 1.5h team syncs • 5h async work
- **Data Ethics**: Strict compliance with MIT IRB guidelines for human data

- **Task Ownership**:
  - No member handles >1 critical path task
  - Pair programming for skill transfer
- **Inclusion Rule**:
  - Technical decisions require consensus
  - Rotating meeting facilitators
- **Learning Commitment**:
  - Weekly skill-sharing sessions
  - Documented study plans in `/learning_logs`
