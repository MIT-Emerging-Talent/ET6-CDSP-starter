# 🚧 Project Constraints – CSDP Team 15

**Boundaries of This Project**  
This project will be guided by the domain, scope, and goals defined in our  
group work. It is shaped by external requirements from the MIT Emerging Talent  
program (including milestone deadlines), and internal decisions we've made as  
a team about time, skills, and project direction. These boundaries help us stay  
stay focused, manage expectations, and collaborate effectively. We will revisit  
these boundaries if project direction or external expectations change.

*Updated per Milestone 0 syllabus guidelines for cross-cultural collaboration  
and constraint definition.*

- **Task Ownership**:
  - No member handles >1 critical path task
  - Pair programming for skill transfer
- **Inclusion Rule**:
  - Technical decisions require consensus
  - Rotating meeting facilitators
- **Learning Commitment**:
  - Weekly skill-sharing sessions
  - Documented study plans in `/learning_logs`
