## Constraints
Some boundaries around our project.

### External
- Meet deadlines for each milestone  
- Use only **Python**  
- **Slack** is the main communication messenger  

### Internal: Involuntary
- Team members come from diverse academic and professional backgrounds, which may result in different perspectives and approaches to problem-solving.  
- Due to other commitments, team members have limited availability.  
- Communication may be asynchronous due to time zone differences, potentially leading to delays in responses and coordination.  

### Internal: Voluntary
- Pull requests will be merged with at least **one approval**  
- We will have **one group call per week**  
- At least **two team members attend the weekly CDSP sessions** and update the other members  
- Provide **constructive and clear feedback** during code reviews, especially if you have questions or suggestions for improvement
