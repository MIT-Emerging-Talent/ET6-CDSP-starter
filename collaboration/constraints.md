# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
  - power or connectivity
  - ...
-->

- *Deadlines Set by MIT-ET*  
  The schedule and priorities of the project are largely influenced by
  deadlines established by MIT-ET.

- *Organizational Requirements*  
  MIT-ET enforces specific tools, workflows, and approval processes that
  the team must adhere to.

## Internal: Involuntary

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->

- *Differences in Skill Levels*  
  Team members have varying levels of experience in Python, programming, and
  collaboration tools, requiring additional time for knowledge sharing and
  onboarding.

- *Limited Availability*  
  Some members manage full-time jobs or family responsibilities,
  reducing their availability for meetings, reviews, or coding sessions.

- *Unexpected Disruptions*  
  Personal issues or emergencies may occasionally hinder
   participation or delay deliverables.

- *Workload Imbalance*  
  Uneven contribution may occur, with some members needing to take on
  extra tasks due to others' limited availability.

## Internal: Voluntary

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
-->

- *Agreed-Upon Coding Standards*  
  The team has chosen to follow consistent coding conventions
  to improve readability and maintainability.

- *Standardized Git Workflow*  
  A version control strategy recommended by MIT-ET has been
  adopted to ensure consistency and traceability.

- *Task Prioritization Approach*  
  The group aligns on priorities, sets milestones, and commits
  to internal deadlines.

- *Commit Message Format*  
  Members use a unified format for commit messages
  to maintain clarity and track changes effectively.

- *Mandatory Peer Code Reviews*  
  All pull requests must be reviewed and approved by at least
  one or two members before merging into the main branch.
