# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
  - power or connectivity
  - ...
-->
- Our project must be completed by the final submission deadline provided by
  MIT Emerging Talent.
- Some team members have limited experience using GitHub, which may slow down
  collaboration and version control at the beginning of the project.
- We are expected to follow the markdown formatting and project structure
  guidelines already provided in the template.
- All datasets must be publicly available under an open license, no paid APIs.
- No funds for commercial software or cloud credits.

## Internal: Involuntary

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->
- **Skill Set**: Team members have experience in Python/numpy,
  not in deep learning or Advanced  ML.
- **Computing resources:** Personal laptops (≤ 16 GB RAM, no dedicated GPU);
  free Colab/Kaggle tiers only → keep raw data ≤ 200 MB.
- **Connectivity:** Some teammates have flaky internet and limited
  GitHub familiarity, which may slow initial collaboration.
- **Time zones:** Distributed team → depend on asynchronous Slack threads and
  occasional live meetings when critical.

## Internal: Voluntary

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
-->

- **Code quality:** Adhere to PEP 8; write clean, well-commented code.
- All changes via pull requests; at least one peer review before merge.
- Focus exclusively on climate topics; ignore feature creep into other domains.
- **Visualization style:** Default to black-and-white charts unless the group
  approves a specific color palette.
- **Reproducibility:** Provide a `requirements.md`/`requirements.txt` and
  ensure notebooks run end-to-end on a fresh environment.
