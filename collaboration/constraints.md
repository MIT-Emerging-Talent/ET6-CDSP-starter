# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

Constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:

- **Project Deadlines**: The team must adhere to deadlines set by stakeholders or clients, which cannot be changed.
- **Unit Test Requirements**: A certain number of unit tests must pass during code reviews to ensure quality and stability.
- **Technology Mandates**: Sometimes clients specify which technologies or tools must be used in the project.
- **Power and Connectivity**: Interruptions in power or internet access can affect progress but are beyond the team’s control.
- **Legal and Regulatory Compliance**: The project must comply with any relevant laws or industry regulations.
- **Third-Party Access**: Reliance on external APIs or services may introduce rate limits or restrictions.

## Internal: Involuntary

Constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:

- **Skill Levels**: Each team member has different expertise and experience which impact what can be done.
- **Time Availability**: Team members have limited time to work on the project due to other obligations.
- **Hardware and Tools**: Access to necessary hardware or software tools may be limited or inconsistent.
- **Domain Knowledge**: Variations in familiarity with the project’s subject matter affect productivity.

## Internal: Voluntary

Constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. They may include:

- **Coding Standards**: The team agrees to follow specific coding styles and conventions to keep the codebase consistent and readable.
- **Code Review Checklist**: A checklist will be used during code reviews to ensure important criteria are met before merging.
- **Working Hours**: The team decides on a sustainable number of hours per week dedicated to the project.
- **Color Palette**: Only black and white colors are used in the UI design for simplicity and consistency.
- **Feature Prioritization**: The team focuses on implementing core features first before adding extras.
- **Communication Channels**: Clear communication protocols are established using tools like Slack or email.
- **Version Control Practices**: Use of branching, pull requests, and regular commits to maintain a clean and manageable repository.
