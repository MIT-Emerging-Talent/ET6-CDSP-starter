# Project Constraints

*Let’s keep it real so we can keep it rolling.*

---

## 📌 Purpose

Every successful project starts with clarity. This document outlines the key
 constraints—both external and internal—that could affect our workflow.
  By identifying these early, we aim to:

* Set realistic expectations
* Plan with flexibility
* Encourage transparency

Our goal is to stay aligned, support one another, and build something great—together.

## 🌍 External Constraints

* **Project Deadlines**: Timelines are determined by our supervisor and must be respected.
* **Power or Internet Issues**: Outages may happen; flexibility and open
 communication will help us manage disruptions.
* **Tool Access**: We're limited to using free or public tools like GitHub and
 Kaggle, which may have limited functionality.
* **Data Availability**: We are restricted to open-access datasets.
 Licensed or proprietary data cannot be used.

## 👥 Internal Constraints (Involuntary)

* **Different Skill Levels**: Our team includes members with varied technical
backgrounds. We’ll rely on mentorship and peer learning to grow together.
* **Time Availability**: Everyone has different schedules due to school, work,
  or personal responsibilities.
* **Other Commitments**: Existing responsibilities outside the project may
  affect participation at times.
* **Unexpected Life Events**: Things like illness, travel, or tech failures can
 occur. Transparency and team adaptability are key.

## 🤝 Internal Constraints (Voluntary)

* **Coding Style & Conventions**: We agree to follow consistent formatting and
 naming practices in our code.
* **Code Reviews**: Every contribution should be reviewed by at least one
  teammate before it’s merged.
* **Meeting Rhythm**: We'll hold two synchronous meetings each week and keep
 each other updated asynchronously on Slack.
* **Decision-Making**: Major decisions will be made by majority vote and clearly
 documented.
* **Version Control**: All work must be tracked via GitHub, with meaningful
 commit messages and proper use of branches.
* **Work Hours**: We respect each other’s availability and aim for a balanced
 workload across the team.

## ✨ Final Note

Constraints don’t hold us back—they help us focus, collaborate smarter, and grow
 together. Let’s stay flexible, proactive, and supportive. This is a team effort,
  and we’re all here to succeed—together.
