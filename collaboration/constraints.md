# 🚧 Project Constraints

Our actions and decisions are shaped by a set of constraints that establish the
boundaries within which we operate. By recognizing and respecting these
constraints, we can stay focused, navigate challenges effectively, and work
collaboratively to achieve our project objectives.

## ⚠️ External Constraints

- **Milestone Deadlines**

  We must strictly follow the milestone deadlines outlined in the project
  timeline. Meeting these deadlines ensures smooth progress, timely reviews,
  and is necessary for successful completion of the program.

- **Workshop Participation**

  At least two members must attend each weekly workshop hosted by the Emerging
  Talent team. It’s important to coordinate attendance in advance and
  communicate any changes responsibly.

- **GitHub Participation**

  Every team member is expected to contribute actively on GitHub—whether it’s
  through coding, documentation, reviewing pull requests, or maintaining an
  organized, up-to-date repository with clear structure and README files.

- **Data Ethics and Responsibility**

  We are committed to handling all data responsibly and ethically. That means
  respecting privacy, ensuring fairness, maintaining transparency, and being
  mindful of data quality—especially during collection and analysis.

- **Connectivity and Resources**

  Poor internet connectivity and frequent power outages for some team members.

## 🔐 Internal Constraints

### 🛠️ Involuntary Constraints

- **Time Zone Differences**

  Our team spans multiple time zones, which can make scheduling real-time
  meetings challenging. We'll use asynchronous tools to bridge the gap.

- **Personal Commitments and Availability**

  Each member brings unique life responsibilities and schedules, which may
  affect their availability at times.

- **Diverse Skill Levels**

  Team members have varying levels of technical experience. This affects task
  distribution, learning curves, and might require extra support for some tasks.

### 🎯 Voluntary Constraints

- **Timely Task Submission**

  Everyone is expected to submit their tasks at least **two days before** each
  milestone deadline. This gives us enough time to review, refine, and finalize
  everything as a team.

- **Weekly Team Meetings**

  We’ll meet every **Wednesday at 10:00 AM EST via Google Meet** to sync up,
  track progress, and resolve any blockers. All meetings should have a clear agenda.

- **Dedicated Working Hours**

  Each member will allocate consistent working hours throughout the week to
  ensure steady progress while maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

- **Feedback Culture**

  We commit to giving and receiving constructive feedback regularly. This helps
  us grow individually and deliver stronger results as a team.

- **Asynchronous Communication and Task Tracking**

  Most communication will happen through **Slack** and **GitHub**. We’ll manage
  our tasks using **GitHub Issues** and **Project Boards** to stay transparent
  and organized.

- **Fair Task Division**

  Workload will be distributed fairly, based on each member’s skills,
  interests, and availability. We’ll stay flexible and support each other where
  needed.

- **Pull Requests**

  A pull request must receive at least one approval and pass all continuous
  integration (CI) checks before it can be merged.
