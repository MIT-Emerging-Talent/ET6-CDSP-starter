# Retrospective Milestone 1

## Stop Doing

- Not consistently documenting tasks and discussions on the project board.  
- Joining meetings without sufficient preparation.
- Strictly enforcing the 80-character line limit in CI checks

## Continue Doing

- Doing an excellent job brainstorming ideas and questions, supporting
each other and actively discussing one another’s topics, helping
verify research novelty and suggesting additional ideas.  
- Holding meetings regularly despite significant time zone
differences.  
- Helping each other with GitHub setup and efficiently distributed tasks
among the active team members.  

## Start Doing

- Using the group project board.
- Start organizing the workflow from the very beginning of the project.
- Better configure pull request policy

## Lessons Learned

- Sharing useful resources, including free datasets, among team members.  
- Discussing topics like image analysis and antibiotics misuse to explore
different domains.
- Taking into account the different time zones of each team member is
important when planning meetings and deadlines.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Excellent team work of active participants as well as excellent asynchronous work
  
### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- While generating many interesting research questions across domains, we
experienced delays in choosing a focus area — next time, we’ll aim for a
more time-efficient and organized selection process.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- There are varying levels of engagement, with some members missing live
meetings and recordings

## Individual Retrospectives

### Alona

- Did a great job with divergent thinking and came up with several  
  original research questions.  
- Actively participated in organizing the team’s work and discussing  
  other group members’ questions.  
- Made progress in convergent thinking.  
- Still needs to improve the skill of conducting preliminary
research before formulating a question.  
- Returned Bernard the cat to its owners

### Cyne

- Due to time zone differences, I was unable to attend most team meetings,
which limited my ability to participate in synchronous discussions.
- I am currently managing some personal challenges, which have affected
my ability to contribute as fully as I intended during this milestone.
- Despite this, I’ve been keeping up with the project’s progress and am
looking forward to contributing more consistently in the next phase.
- I appreciate my team’s flexibility and support, and I plan to better coordinate
my availability and communication for upcoming milestones.
