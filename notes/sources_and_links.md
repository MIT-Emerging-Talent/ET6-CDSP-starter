## **Mohammad Ziadah**

**How accurately can alternative digital data—such as phone usage patterns and**
**remittance transactions—predict a migrant's eligibility for microloans in the**
**absence of a formal credit history?**

- **Feasible:** Mobile usage and remittance data are available and can be
 analyzed with AI.
- **Relevant:** Migrants' financial exclusion limits stability and growth.
- **Ethical:** Promotes fair, consent-based lending alternatives.
- **Specific:** Focused on migrants, using phone/remittance data
  to assess microloan eligibility.
- **Complex:** Spans finance, tech, policy, and ethics.
- **Original:** Few data-driven tools exist targeting migrant access via
  digital behavior.

**Enabling Financial Services Access for Migrants Through Blockchain-Native**
**Creditworthiness and On-Chain Risk Analytics**

### **Core Idea**

Design a blockchain-native creditworthiness model using on-chain behavior and
digital asset history to infer migrant financial trustworthiness. The model will
also include real-time risk detection for illicit or suspicious activities.

- **Feasible:** Uses publicly available blockchain data (e.g., Ethereum).
- **Relevant:** Addresses financial exclusion and blockchain innovation.
- **Ethical:** Requires strong privacy and bias mitigation.
- **Specific:** Targets migrants, focuses on on-chain analytics and
  reputation-based scoring.
- **Complex:** Involves transaction graph analysis, fraud detection, and credit modeling.
- **Original:** Combines DeFi access with risk monitoring for underserved populations.

### **PICOT Framework**

- **P (Population):** Migrants without formal credit but with on-chain activity.
- **I (Intervention):** Blockchain-native credit scoring and anomaly detection system.
- **C (Comparison):** Existing no-access or demographic-only systems.
- **O (Outcomes):**
  - Primary: Increased approval rates and reduced fraud.
  - Secondary: Accurate illicit activity detection.
- **T (Time):** Based on 12–24 months of on-chain behavior.

**Can Cryptocurrency Bridge the Credit Gap for Immigrants?**

### **FRESCO-Aligned Problem Statement**

- **Feasible:** Data from World Bank, IMF, and Chainalysis is available.
- **Relevant:** Banks often deny immigrants credit due to documentation gaps.
- **Ethical:** No sensitive data is used; risks like volatility are acknowledged.
- **Specific:** Analyzes whether crypto use improves financial access.
- **Creative/Original:** Explores under-researched connections between crypto
   behavior and migrant financial inclusion.

### **Key Areas of Focus**

- Cryptocurrency wallet usage
- Remittance behavior via crypto
- DeFi participation among migrant groups
- Simulation of credit models using crypto-based metrics
