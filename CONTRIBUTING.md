## 📁 Repository Structure & Branching

- **Main branch:** Never commit directly to `main`. Use Pull Requests (PRs).
- **Branches:** Create task-specific branches using clear names,  
  e.g., `data-cleaning`, `feature-ml-model`.
- **Folders:**  
  - Each milestone has a dedicated folder.  
  - The top-level `README.md` contains the project overview.  
  - Meeting minutes are stored in `notes/meeting_minutes/`.

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Sync your local main branch:**

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    ```

2. **Create and switch to a new branch:**

    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```

3. **Make your changes, then commit with a clear message:**

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Brief and meaningful message"
    ```

4. **Push your branch to GitHub:**

    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```

5. **Open a Pull Request:**

    - From your branch to `main`.
    - Request at least one team member to review.

6. **Pass all checks and wait for approval before merging.**

7. **Complete work well before deadlines** to allow time for review.
