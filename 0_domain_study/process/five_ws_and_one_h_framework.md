## Problem 1

* Author: [Salem Amassi](https://github.com/salemAmassi)
* Problem Statement: [Refere to problems_pool](/0_domain_study/problems_pool.md#problem-1)
* 5 Ws and 1 H Framework:

## 1.1. Summary Table

| **Aspect** | **Summary** |
|------------|-------------|
| **Who** | - College students in online learning (e.g., Gaza) - Instructors, admins, counselors, data scientists |
| **What** | - Predict academic risk: dropout, score drops, stress levels - Data: grades, behavior, conflict timelines |
| **When** | - During semester, especially post-attacks or around deadlines - Predictions updated weekly or in real-time |
| **Where** | - Conflict zones (e.g., Gaza)- Data from LMS, messaging apps, humanitarian sources |
| **Why** | - Conflict harms student performance - Need to detect stress early to support learning and well-being |
| **How** | - Analyze LMS interactions and timelines - Correlate with conflict events - Build predictive models for risk |

## 1.2. Details

### 1. **Who**

**Affected People:**

* College students in online learning environments,
primarily in conflict zones (e.g., Gaza)

**Stakeholders:**

* Instructors: who need early alerts to intervene
* School administrators: to design support systems
* Mental health counselors: for timely outreach
* Data scientists: building predictive models

---

### 2. **What**

**Problem:**

* Early signs of stress and disengagement often go unnoticed until
performance drops significantly.

**What do we want to predict?**

* Academic risk, such as:
  * Dropout or course failure
  * Sudden drops in quiz/assignment scores
  * Stress risk level (low/medium/high)

**What data is needed?**

* Academic performance (grades, submissions)
* Behavioral signals (logins, inactivity)
* Displacement orders and military activity logs

---

### 3. **When**

**When does the issue occur?**

* Throughout the course, but especially:
  * After major conflict events (e.g., bombings, displacements)
  * Near deadlines or exams
  * After long inactivity periods

**When should predictions be made?**

* Continuously (weekly or real-time updates)
* Ideally early in the semester for proactive intervention

---

### 4. **Where**

**Where are the students located?**

* In conflict-affected areas (e.g., Gaza)
* Often displaced and facing infrastructure disruption

**Where will the data be collected?**

* Within Learning Management Systems (e.g., Moodle, Google Classroom, Canvas)
* Messaging platforms (e.g., WhatsApp, Telegram) in low-connectivity settings (in production version)
* Learning analytics tools or app logs
* International humanitarian institutions tracking war-related events

---

### 5. **Why**

**Why is this important?**

* Students in high-stress environments are at risk of academic failure or dropout
* Early detection can:
  * Save academic careers
  * Improve mental health outcomes
  * Enable personalized, compassionate support

**Why now?**

* The ongoing war in Gaza has deeply disrupted education
* Traditional support systems are broken
* Online learning is the primary method for displaced students — and it's rich in
behavioral signals

## 2.2 Details

### **Who**

**University students in war-affected zones**, such as:

* Gaza
* Ukraine
* Syria

**Especially those:**

* Enrolled in online higher education (e.g., IT programs)
* Experiencing conflict-induced stress
* Using online platforms to learn
* Potentially relying on AI tools for support — or academic dishonesty

---

### **What**

**Investigating:**

* How conflict-related stress affects learning performance
* How AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly, Copilot) are being used

**Key questions:**

* What patterns of AI usage exist under stress?
* Are students using AI to cheat, cope, or enhance learning?
* How does this correlate with:
  * Academic performance (grades)
  * Engagement
  * Emotional resilience

### **When**

**During periods of ongoing armed conflict**, including:

* Bombings or military activity
* Internet/power outages
* Emotional distress and displacement

---

### **Where**

**In war-affected regions**, such as:

* Universities in Gaza, Ukraine, etc.
* Displaced students studying from refugee camps

**Data sources:**

* LMS data from local universities
* Surveys from displaced students
* AI usage logs from digital platforms
* War events to link activites with them.

### **Why**

**To understand:**

* The impact of war-related stress on learning outcomes
* Whether AI tools help or harm students under pressure
* How to design ethical, AI-integrated education systems for crisis contexts
