# Workflow

Throughout our **Thinking** and **Brainstorming** workflow, we consistently applied both **Divergent** and **Convergent** thinking in an iterative manner. This allowed us to creatively explore a wide range of possibilities before narrowing them down
into focused, actionable directions.

## 1. Choosing a Domain of Interest

### 1.1. Process

* Prior to our meeting on **2025-06-06**, we created a poll as a pre-meeting activity to gather input from all team members on potential domains of interest.
  You can view the poll results in the [meeting agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zahZ02WABX2AjxJR1ysF6Vk9mBteEcLbklt6Sd2x0-g/edit?usp=sharing).

  * **Divergent thinking**: At this stage, we encouraged everyone to propose any and all domains they found compelling.
* After a collaborative discussion during the meeting, we unanimously agreed to focus on the **Education** domain.

  * **Convergent thinking**: We critically evaluated all suggestions and collectively selected a single domain to move forward with.

## 2. Exploring Subdomains

### 2.1. Process

* Each team member contributed by sharing their **personal experiences and observations** related to education within their communities.

* Drawing from these lived experiences, we collaboratively identified several **key subtopics** to explore further:

  1. Online learning in war-affected areas
  2. The impact of AI on online learning
  3. Challenges of online learning
  4. Reimagining and designing improved online learning experiences

* To deepen our understanding, each team member took on a specific subtopic and conducted independent research.

* We organized and documented the findings in a structured manner within the categorized [resources folder](/0_domain_study/resources/).

  * **Divergent thinking**: This step involved open exploration of diverse resources and perspectives.
  * **Convergent thinking**: We synthesized findings into themes to guide the next steps.

## 3. Formulating Possible Problems in the Domain

### 3.1. Process

* Nearly every team member drafted **initial problem statements** along with corresponding **research questions** based on our exploration.
* To ensure clarity and depth, we applied the [**5 Ws and 1 H** framework](/0_domain_study/process/five_ws_and_one_h_framework.md) (Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How) to each problem. This helped us examine each potential issue from multiple
angles and understand its context, causes, and implications.

  * **Divergent thinking**: Generating diverse problem perspectives.
  * **Convergent thinking**: Using structured frameworks to assess and refine them.

## 4. Finalizing the Problem Statement

* In addition to our regular meeting on **Friday, 13/06**, we held an **urgent meeting on Thursday, 12/06**, to accelerate our progress in finalizing the problem.
* These two focused sessions enabled us to reflect on the refined problem formulations and collaboratively agree on our **final problem statement**.

  * **Convergent thinking**: We synthesized all prior work and reached a collective decision on a clearly defined problem to guide our project.
