### Problem idea 1 from Norbert

How can data-driven insights from student interaction with digital learning platforms be used to personalize instruction and improve educational outcomes in under-resourced schools?

## Raneem

### problem idea 1

Excessive reliance on AI in educational settings may lead to a diminished sense of agency among students and educators. This means that individuals may feel less empowered to make independent choices, potentially impacting motivation and personal growth.

#### possible research questions 1

What impact does the use of AI in educational settings have on students' daily behaviors and routines?

### problem idea 2

Over-reliance on AI tools for tasks like writing, problem-solving, and research can lead students to become passive consumers of
information. This dependency may hinder the development of essential cognitive skills, such as critical thinking and creativity, as students may go for instant AI-generated solutions instead of engaging in deep, reflective thought.

#### possible research questions 2

How does the integration of AI tools in academic learning environments influence students’ motivation to engage in deeper exploration of curriculum topics, beyond surface-level understanding?

### problem idea 3

In war-affected regions, students are often forced to pursue their education through online platforms under extremely challenging conditions. Unlike typical online learning environments, these students face constant exposure to violence, displacement,
unreliable internet access, and psychological distress, including stress, fear, and trauma. These factors significantly impact their mental well-being and academic performance. Despite these hardships, students are still expected to stay engaged and
perform well academically, which can be an overwhelming burden.
This study aims to investigate the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in supporting the learning experience of students in conflict zones.

#### possible research questions 3

Can AI-based educational tools and platforms help ease the learning process, improve student engagement, and enhance academic performance — or do they present additional challenges or have no significant impact?

How could AI improve student’s motivation and participation during online learning in
war affected countries?

How AI affects student’s motivation and participation during online learning in war affected countries?

### Problem 1

> How can we use behavioral and interaction data from online learning platforms
> to model the effect of stress (caused by conflict-related events) on students'
> learning performance in war-affected zones?
> [5 Ws and 1H](/0_domain_study/5Ws_and_1_H.md#problem-1)

### Problem 2

How can we use behavioral and interaction data from online learning platforms to
model the impact of conflict-induced stress on students’ academic performance in
war-affected zones, and examine the role of AI tools—both as learning aids and
potential sources of academic dishonesty (e.g., cheating)—under these conditions?

## Viktoriya

### Problem 3

How does the ongoing conflict in war-affected regions impact student engagement and retention in online learning courses, as reflected by user behavior data on platforms like Udemy, Coursera, and edX?

### Problem 4

How can online learning platforms optimize course pricing to balance affordability for students in war-affected regions with profitability, while considering local economic conditions and demand elasticity?

*Problem Statement:*

War disrupts traditional schooling. The project aims to evaluate whether online learning is a viable solution and to identify the conditions that contribute to its success.

*Research Question:*

How effective is online learning in improving educational outcomes for students in war-affected areas, and what factors influence its success?
