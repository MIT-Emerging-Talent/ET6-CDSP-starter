## Key Stakeholders

1. **College Students**
   As primary beneficiaries, college students—especially those affected by conflict or displacement—rely on accessible, inclusive, and adaptive learning environments to continue their education and build a stable future.

2. **Humanitarian and International Education Institutions**
   Organizations such as *Education Cannot Wait (ECW)*, *UNHCR*, and other UN agencies, NGOs, and education-focused global funds play a central role in funding, coordinating, and delivering education in emergencies and protracted crises.

3. **College Teachers and Academic Instructors**
   Educators are frontline implementers of learning initiatives, responsible for adapting curricula, supporting student engagement (often in unstable conditions), and integrating innovative tools—such as AI—to meet students' evolving needs.
