# üìù Introduction

 Group 22 engaged in a thoughtful brainstorming and evaluation process to
 identify a high-impact, data-driven project. Our goal was to choose a research
 question that is relevant, actionable, and supported by available datasets.
 Throughout this process, we explored a wide range of domains including
 **education, humanitarian issues, financial technology, employment, supply
 chain management, and the impact of this very program on career outcomes**
.

The following is a structured summary of the ideas we discussed, along with
their associated research questions and sub-questions. This documentation reflects
the depth of our collaboration and the progression toward selecting our final
project focus.
