# Domain Study

## Brainstorming Workflow

> We thoroughly documented our thought process throughout the project, capturing how we continuously shifted between **divergent thinking** and **onvergent thinking**.\
In **divergent thinking** where we explored multiple possibilities, generated ideas, and considered various perspectives.\
In **convergent thinking** where we narrowed down options, synthesized insights, and made decisions. This iterative approach was applied at each step of the process, enabling us to balance creativity with focus
and ensure our solutions were both innovative and grounded in clear reasoning.\

## Problems Pool

>This document compiles a range of problem statements and research questions generated through brainstorming sessions, focusing on education in challenging contextsâ€”particularly war-affected\
regions and the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and online learning platforms.

The problems are grouped into several thematic areas:

1. **AI and Student Agency**:
   * Concerns about students and educators becoming overly reliant on AI tools, which may reduce personal agency, motivation, and cognitive skill development such as critical thinking and creativity.
2. **AI in Conflict Zones**:
   * Investigations into how AI can support or hinder students in war-affected areas. Questions include whether AI tools can improve engagement, learning outcomes, or pose new challenges under extreme conditions.
3. **Behavioral and Interaction Data**:
   * Exploring how data from digital learning platforms can be used to understand and model the impact of stress (especially due to conflict) on studentsâ€™ academic performance and engagement.
4. **Online Learning in War Contexts**:
   * Assessing the overall effectiveness of online learning as a substitute for traditional schooling during war, including identifying the conditions necessary for its success.
5. **Platform-Specific Insights**:
   * Analyzing user behavior data from platforms like Udemy, Coursera, and edX to assess student engagement and retention in conflict settings.
   * Studying pricing strategies on online learning platforms that balance affordability for students in war-torn regions with economic sustainability.
  
## Systems Thinking

* In this file we have applied the iceberg model on our problem statement to better view and understand the constraints and reasons behind the trends and patterns happening in the context of the problem.

## Five Ws and One H Framework

* We have used this conceptual framework to better identify key stakeholders, time, and place and reasons behind the problem.
