# 🧠 Domain Study – Chatbot vs Human vs Hybrid Support in Mental Health Apps

Welcome to the domain research space for our collaborative data science project.
This folder gathers the foundational work that helps us understand the
**landscape of digital mental health support**, particularly across
**chatbot, human, and hybrid models**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Mental health apps are increasingly used to fill gaps in traditional care.
These platforms often rely on:

- 🤖 AI-driven **chatbots**
- 🧑‍⚕️ In-app **human support**
- 🔁 **Hybrid systems** that blend both

Our team is investigating how users experience these models—emotionally,
culturally, and practically—across different regions. We’ll use natural
language processing, sentiment analysis, and real user data to explore
perceptions of trust, empathy, and effectiveness in digital mental health platforms.

This folder helps anchor that work.

## 🗂️ Files & What They Include

### 📄 Problem Statement  
>
> Establishes the core research question and its global relevance.  
Outlines the growing mental health burden and the rise of digital interventions,
with focus on emotional outcomes across chatbot, human, and hybrid formats.

### 📚 Literature & Resources  
>
> Will summarize existing research on digital mental health, chatbot therapy,
hybrid systems, and cross-cultural emotional design.  
We aim to highlight both academic findings and practitioner insights (e.g.,
whitepapers, evaluations).

### 🌏 Cultural Contexts
>
> This section will explore how cultural norms, stigma, and emotional expression
shape user experiences.  
Example: In some cultures, emotional openness is discouraged, making chatbot
anonymity preferred.

### 🛠️ Technical Concepts *(upcoming)*  
>
> Will define and explain concepts like NLP, sentiment scoring, clustering, and
emotion detection.  
These are central to how we’ll analyze user reviews and conversations.
