## 📌 Problem Statement (Based on Team's Personal Experiences)

**Research Question:**  
_What type of linguistic features in phishing emails influence user click-through behavior?_

Phishing is a growing concern globally. Based on personal experiences:

- **Meklit** (Canada) frequently encounters smishing and phishing at work. One incident involved a fake OneDrive link flagged by IT — highlighting how rushed environments reduce our vigilance.
- **Mahdia** (Portugal) emphasized how scammers use sophisticated linguistic techniques to appear trustworthy and manipulate users.
- **Ahmad** often receives fake IT department emails at work and personal prize scams. He noticed a clear difference in language tone: urgent and professional at work vs emotional in personal life.
- **Semira** initially fell for fake malware alerts and learned over time to spot psychological manipulation such as fake tax threats or UPS warnings. She now verifies and reports these attempts.
- **Musab** (USA) stressed the emotional toll of constant phishing attempts and how phishing poses both legal and financial risks.

Together, we observed that phishing strategies are becoming more **emotionally manipulative**, **context-aware**, and **linguistically advanced**, requiring in-depth study of their language patterns.

## 🧠 Our Understanding of the Problem Domain (Using Systems Thinking)

Phishing is a **socio-technical** problem involving three interconnected components:

1. **Phishers (Attackers):**  
   Skilled in social engineering. Use language to create urgency, trust, fear, or curiosity.

2. **Communication Channels:**  
   Mainly email, but also SMS (smishing) and voice (vishing). All channels aim to prompt the user into clicking or responding.

3. **Recipients (Targets):**  
   Everyday users or professionals. Often fall victim due to low awareness, poor digital hygiene, or stress.

We particularly focus on the **linguistic layer**—how language is engineered to bypass cognitive defenses and influence behavior.

## 📚 Background Review of the Domain

### 1. **Human Psychology and Language Triggers**

- **Emotions** like fear, urgency, or reward are widely used in phishing (Jakobsson & Myers, 2006).
- **Users acting under pressure** are less likely to evaluate messages critically (Vishwanath et al., 2011).

### 2. **Phishing Detection Tools**

- Tools like email filters, browser warnings, and ML-based classifiers can detect known phishing messages (Bergholz et al., 2010).
- However, attackers adapt quickly with new linguistic patterns to bypass these systems.

### 3. **User Education**

- Training and awareness programs are effective but vary in success.
- **Interactive and ongoing training** is more impactful than one-off sessions (Jansson & Von Solms, 2013).

### 4. **Evolving Threat Landscape**

- **Spear phishing** and **smishing** are on the rise (Hong, 2012).
- Smartphones and social platforms open new vectors.
- Despite evolution, **email remains the most common attack method** (CISA, 2023).

### Conclusion

Phishing success stems largely from **manipulating language to trigger impulsive reactions**. Understanding this manipulation can help in detection and prevention.
