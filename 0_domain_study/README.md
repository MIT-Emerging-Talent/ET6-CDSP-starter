## 📌 Problem Statement (Based on Team's Personal Experiences)

**Research Question:**  
_What type of linguistic features in phishing emails influence user click-through behavior?_

Phishing is a growing concern globally. Based on personal experiences:

- **Meklit** (Canada) frequently encounters smishing and phishing at work. One incident involved a fake OneDrive link flagged by IT — highlighting how rushed environments reduce our vigilance.
- **Mahdia** (Portugal) emphasized how scammers use sophisticated linguistic techniques to appear trustworthy and manipulate users.
- **Ahmad** often receives fake IT department emails at work and personal prize scams. He noticed a clear difference in language tone: urgent and professional at work vs emotional in personal life.
- **Semira** initially was intrigued about fake malware by watching anti-virus software finds. She bolstered her cybersecurity knowledge through research and workshop to spot psychological manipulation such as fake tax threats or UPS warnings. She now verifies and reports these attempts.
- **Musab** (USA) stressed the emotional toll of constant phishing attempts and how phishing poses both legal and financial risks.

Together, we observed that phishing strategies are becoming more **emotionally manipulative**, **context-aware**, and **linguistically advanced**, requiring in-depth study of their language patterns.

## 🧠 Our Understanding of the Problem Domain (Using Systems Thinking)

Phishing is a **socio-technical** problem involving three interconnected components:

1. **Phishers (Attackers):**  
   Skilled in social engineering. Use language to create urgency, trust, fear, or curiosity.

2. **Communication Channels:**  
   Mainly email, but also SMS (smishing) and voice (vishing). All channels aim to prompt the user into clicking or responding.

3. **Recipients (Targets):**  
   Everyday users or professionals. Often fall victim due to low awareness, poor digital hygiene, or stress.

We particularly focus on the **linguistic layer**—how language is engineered to bypass cognitive defenses and influence behavior.

## ❓ Research Question

We updated the research question from the above to

>**A Linguistic Analysis of Phishing vs Legitimate Emails: Identifying Common Patterns and Language Tactics**

Given email’s dominant role in phishing, and the centrality of language in deceiving recipients, this research question aims to uncover patterns in wording, tone, and psychological triggers. The revised question aims to address for the lack of data in user click through behavior while still uncovering lingustic patterns
in phishing and legitimate emails.

## 📚 Background Review of the Domain

### 1. **Human Psychology and Language Triggers**

- **Emotions** like fear, urgency, or reward are widely used in phishing (Jakobsson & Myers, 2006).
- **Users acting under pressure** are less likely to evaluate messages critically (Vishwanath et al., 2011).

### 2. **Phishing Detection Tools**

- Tools like email filters, browser warnings, and ML-based classifiers can detect known phishing messages (Bergholz et al., 2010).
- However, attackers adapt quickly with new linguistic patterns to bypass these systems.

### 3. **User Education**

- Training and awareness programs are effective but vary in success.
- **Interactive and ongoing training** is more impactful than one-off sessions (Jansson & Von Solms, 2013).

### 4. **Evolving Threat Landscape**

- **Spear phishing** and **smishing** are on the rise (Hong, 2012).
- Smartphones and social platforms open new vectors.
- Despite evolution, **email remains the most common attack method** (CISA, 2023).

### Conclusion

Phishing success stems largely from **manipulating language to trigger impulsive reactions**. Understanding this manipulation can help in detection and prevention.
