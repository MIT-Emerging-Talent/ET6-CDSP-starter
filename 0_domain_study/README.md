# Domain Study: Immigration Law & Juvenile Justice Systems (United States)

## Research Process Overview

Our team followed a **divergent → convergent** workflow:

1. **Divergent phase** –
mapped multiple domains (education, climate, health, immigration).  
2. **Background scanning** –
collected key papers, the EOIR dataset, NGO reports, and recent news.  
3. **FRESCO scoring** –
ranked each draft question on
Feasibility, Relevance, Ethics, Specificity, Complexity, and Originality.  
4. **Convergent phase** –
immigration & juvenile justice emerged as the top-scoring domain
(see full notes →
[Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wo8sHQ3FvOEXaQ5oRqN3xzSI-P6H3Mz-ySBnWYSa9dc/edit?usp=sharing)
).
5. **Focus refinement** –
narrowed scope to *access to counsel* and *case outcomes* for immigrant juveniles.

This process culminated in the research question below.

## Problem Statement
> <!-- One concise paragraph describing the real-world problems as you 
> (or someone you know) experienced it.  
> Explain who is affected and why it matters. -->
Immigrant juveniles navigating the U.S. immigration system face significant
and growing barriers, especially due to recent policy changes that
restrict access to legal representation and critical support services. Without
proper legal aid, court interpreters, or guidance, many children — often appearing
in court alone — are unable to effectively advocate for their protection and fair
treatment. This vulnerability is compounded by longer detention times, increased
court backlogs, and language barriers, all of which severely impact their
chances of securing safety and reunification. As displaced students and
community members familiar with these struggles, we recognize that these
systemic gaps disproportionately harm immigrant children, placing thousands at
risk of deportation and trauma. This project aims to shed light on these
challenges and advocate for urgent reforms to ensure equitable legal protection
for immigrant youth.

## Background Review

Immigrant juveniles in the U.S. face growing challenges
due to stricter immigration policies, especially under the Trump administration.
New rules make it harder for children in ORR custody to reunite with family
by imposing tough sponsor requirements like DNA tests and proof of income.
Legal aid funding cuts leave many children to face immigration courts alone,
reducing their chances of staying in the country. Increased involvement
of immigration enforcement in child welfare discourages families
from sponsoring these children. Together, these policies create
systemic barriers that prolong detention and increase the risk of deportation
for vulnerable immigrant youths.

## Group Understanding & breakingdown of the background review

We applied systems thinking to the topic domain and the four previously
cited articles, to understand the complex, interconnected issues
immigrant juveniles face in accessing legal representation and reuniting
with family in the U.S. These systemic challenges result
from evolving immigration policies, funding instability, enforcement practices,
and underlying beliefs about immigrant children and legal rights.
Below is an overview organized into events, patterns/trends, structural factors,
and mental models shaping this system:

### Events  

- The Trump administration ended funding for legal representation
of nearly 26,000 unaccompanied migrant children, severely limiting access
to counsel.  
- Children face prolonged detention due to new, restrictive sponsor eligibility
requirements, including DNA testing, proof of income, and biometric data.  
- ICE and DHS conduct surprise “welfare checks” at potential sponsors’ homes,
deterring families from stepping forward.  
- Deportation hearings are frequently fast-tracked, pressuring children
to represent themselves without adequate legal support.  
- Legal aid organizations struggle with unstable funding and reduced capacity.  

### Patterns / Trends  

- A consistent rise in unrepresented immigrant juveniles correlates with stricter
immigration policies.  
- Children without attorneys have much lower appearance rates in court
and higher deportation risks.  
- Detention times have tripled on average, causing increased trauma and distress.
- Families increasingly avoid sponsoring due to fear of enforcement actions.  
- Legal aid funding remains vulnerable to political shifts,
undermining long-term support.  

### Structure  

- Immigration courts do not guarantee legal representation for juveniles,
unlike criminal courts.  
- Legal aid depends on federal contracts subject to abrupt termination,
limiting stability.  
- Sponsor approval involves complex and invasive documentation requirements.  
- Court systems use “rocket docket” procedures, rushing hearings
and disadvantaging unrepresented children.  
- Support systems (non-profits, social services) lack capacity to respond quickly
to policy changes.  

### Mental Models  

- Legal representation for immigrant children is widely viewed as discretionary,
not a right.  
- Child welfare is often deprioritized in favor of immigration enforcement.  
- Assumptions persist that stricter enforcement deters migration,
even at children’s expense.  
- Some policymakers and system actors believe children can self-represent
or do not deserve counsel.  
- ***Our group hold that every child deserves protection,
fairness, and legal voice, regardless of immigration status.***

## Research Question

“How do changes in U.S. immigration policy under the current administration
affect access to legal representation and outcomes
for immigrant juveniles seeking protection?”
