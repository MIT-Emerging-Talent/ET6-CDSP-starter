## Event

In the modern time, the evolution of technology has transformed the way people
navigate their professional lives. Nowadays, online job platforms serve as a
shared environment between recruiters and job seekers.
The influence of internet has become central to recruitment strategies, hence, the
recruitment process has increasingly moved online. This shift has also brought
new challenges, as although the number of global job postings is increasing
with this shift, not all of them are legitimate.

Online job scams surged by 84% in 2023 worldwide. The rise of remote work,
online recruiting, and AI tools has made it easier for scammers to create
convincing fake job ads. This concerning trend continues to escalate, blurring
the line between legitimate opportunities and fraudulent schemes. It has become
crucial to understand what specific features in job postings and application
processes influence individuals’ engagement, and more importantly, their ability
to recognize and avoid scams.

This research aims to explore the role of visual and textual elements,
application process, along with LLMs in shaping user perceptions and actions
in the online job-seeking environment.

## Pattern

One emerging pattern is the use of highly attractive job descriptions and offers,
often mimicking real postings. These ads typically highlight flexible hours,
remote work, and unusually high salaries, features that immediately catch the
attention of job seekers, especially those urgently looking for income or remote
opportunities.

Simultaneously, scammers have become more sophisticated in how they design and
execute fake job listings. Leveraging LLMs,
they craft professional-sounding job descriptions and even imitate the branding
of real companies. These tools allow scammers to avoid earlier red flags such
as poor grammar or suspicious formatting, making the scams appear more credible
and trustworthy.

A major red flag in many scams involves the request for upfront payments. Whether
it's for background checks, training materials, or equipment, fraudulent
postings often ask for money early in the process with a promise of being paid back.
Patterns show that the
decision to proceed or back out often depends on how the request is framed. If the
request is made after a series of
seemingly normal interactions, people are more likely to comply, especially if
they’ve already invested time and emotional energy in the application.

## Structure

At a structural level, one of the key reasons online job scams are so effective
is that fraudulent processes often mimic the legitimate structure of real hiring
systems. Across industries and regions, job applications tend to follow a
standardized format. Most job seekers are familiar with being asked for personal
details such as **_full name_**, **_address, date of birth, contact information_**,
and even **_bank details_** in some cases. In many cases,
**_background checks_** and **_document verification_** are also expected steps.
These practices are so deeply rooted in professional norms that applicants rarely
question them, which makes it easier for scammers to
blend in without raising suspicion.

## Mental Mode

Underlying beliefs and social pressures play a significant role in sustaining
the system in which online job scams thrive. One core belief is rooted in the
reality that the global job market is increasingly competitive. With more
individuals seeking employment than there are available positions, people often
feel immense pressure to secure a job as quickly as possible. This urgency is
further amplified by the growing concerns over financial stability and societal
expectations. Therefore, job seekers may be more willing
to overlook potential red flags if it means landing a promising opportunity.

Additionally, feelings of shame and embarrassment further enforce the system.
Victims of job scams often blame themselves, fearing judgment if
they share their experience. This silence prevents others from learning about
common scam tactics and creates an environment where fraudulent practices can
continue unchecked.
Along with the fact that this issue is viewed
as individual problems, rather than systemic ones. Society often emphasizes
personal responsibility, encouraging individuals to “try harder” or
“be more careful”, instead of addressing broader structural issues.

These internalized beliefs about urgency, personal failure,
and individual responsibility, act as invisible forces that keep the scam
ecosystem alive and difficult to disrupt.

## Conclusion

By mapping the user journey, we can better understand how people navigate scam
encounters. When users say, “ _**What would I lose? I’ll apply and see how this
goes,**_ ” it reflects a sense of low-risk experimentation driven by desperation
or hope. Internally, they may think,
“ _**I can’t help but set high hopes incase I get the offer,**_ ”
revealing the emotional vulnerability that scammers exploit. Behaviorally, users
often proceed to apply despite some awareness of scams. Emotionally, the journey
is intense, initial excitement when
they’re contacted, followed by feelings of disappointment, panic, and
discouragement once they realize the offer was fake.

This research aims to deeply understand the
online job-seeking experience from the user's perspective, empathizing with their
motivations, behaviors, and emotional journey. By this research we're planing to
go beyond just raising awareness, and actually identify patterns to build
preventative strategies, platform-level solutions, and behavioral cues that
empower users earlier in the process.
