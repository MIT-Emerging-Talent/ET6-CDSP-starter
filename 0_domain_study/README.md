# üìò Research Project: Blockchain-Based Credit Systems for Migrant Financial Inclusion

## üîç Research Focus

**Can blockchain-based identity and credit systems provide a viable solution to
financial exclusion among migrants and refugees who lack access to traditional
banking services?**

This project explores how blockchain can be used to assess creditworthiness and
unlock access to essential financial services for underserved migrant
communities.

## üß© Key Concepts

- **Financial Exclusion**: Migrants and refugees often lack credit histories or
  documentation, limiting access to banking.
- **Blockchain Technology**: Decentralized, tamper-proof systems offer
  transparent and portable digital identities.
- **AI-Driven Credit Scoring**: Models that leverage non-traditional data to
  assess trustworthiness and risk.
- **On-Chain Analytics**: Use of blockchain metadata to detect fraud and predict
  default.
- **Ethical Design**: Ensuring privacy, consent, fairness, and accessibility in
  fintech solutions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Approach

Our approach is focused on testing blockchain and AI models using available
alternative datasets. We will:

- Simulate credit scoring using mobile usage, remittance flows, and on-chain
  data
- Build on-chain risk profiling models to detect anomalies and fraud
- Benchmark blockchain-native credit systems against traditional ones
- Analyze inclusion impacts, model transparency, and ethical tradeoffs
