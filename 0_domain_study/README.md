## 🌍 Domain Overview: Climate Change & Urban Heatwaves

This folder contains our team’s research notes, resources, and summaries related
to our domain: climate change and its impacts on urban systems. Our focus is on
understanding how rising temperatures—especially in the form of extreme heat
events—are affecting rapidly growing cities, and what this means for public
health, infrastructure, and vulnerable communities.

## 🧭 Background & Relevance

Climate change is no longer a distant threat — it is a current reality reshaping
life in cities around the world. One of the most severe and immediate
manifestations is the rise in extreme heat events, particularly in urban
environments. These environments are especially vulnerable due to the
**urban heat island (UHI) effect**, where buildings, roads, and dense
development trap heat and raise local temperatures.

As cities expand, they often outpace the infrastructure needed to protect their
populations. Heatwaves in these areas can strain power grids, overload health
services, and threaten the lives of people living in poorly ventilated housing
or without access to cooling. Vulnerable populations — including
residents, outdoor workers, and low-income families — are disproportionately affected.

Understanding how heatwaves have changed in duration and intensity over time
can help cities prepare and adapt through early warning systems, green
infrastructure, and targeted energy policies.

## Problem Statement

  In both rural and urban Nigerian communities, residents are facing increasing
  challenges in accessing reliable and affordable electricity. In rural areas
  like my father’s community, power outages persist despite ongoing payments for
  repairs, forcing many to turn to solar energy or generators. In cities like Lagos,
  even with reduced appliance use, electricity bills continue to rise — especially
  during heat waves. These patterns suggest a deeper mismatch between energy
  infrastructure, pricing policies, and climate-related stresses. This tension is
  pushing residents, especially those most vulnerable to heat, to seek alternative
  energy sources — highlighting a growing gap between public infrastructure and
  real-world needs.

## ❓ Research Question & Scope

**Main Research Question:**  
*“How have the duration and peak intensity of summertime heat waves (X) changed
over the 1990–2024 period (Y) in rapidly urbanizing metropolitan areas (Z),
and what does that imply for public-health officials, energy utilities,
and heat-vulnerable residents?”*

### 🔍 Breaking it Down

- **X – What:** Duration (number of days) and peak intensity
(maximum temperature) of heat waves  
- **Y – When:** 1990 to 2024  
- **Z – Where:** Rapidly urbanizing cities in regions like North Africa,
Southeast Asia, or the Middle East

We aim to explore how these patterns have shifted over time and how these shifts
create new challenges for:

- Public-health officials designing emergency response systems
- Energy providers managing electricity demand (especially for cooling)
- Urban planners focused on protecting at-risk populations

## 📊 Data & Literature Foundations

We will be reviewing:

- Temperature datasets including:
  - **NASA MODIS** Land Surface Temperature
  - **NOAA GHCN** (Global Historical Climatology Network)
- IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (especially chapters on urban adaptation)
- Academic papers on:
  - Urban Heat Island effects
  - Climate change and urbanization
  - Heatwave definitions and thresholds

We will also review definitions of heatwaves from different climate
organizations to determine appropriate thresholds (e.g., 90th percentile
temperature for 3+ consecutive days).

## ✅ Next Steps

- Finalize metropolitan areas as our study focus  
- Define a consistent method for identifying and measuring heatwaves  
- Continue summarizing relevant papers and datasets  
- Prepare for data collecting in the next milestone
