# Milestone 1 – Retail Supply Chain Delays

## Background  

In this milestone, our team explored several promising project ideas across various domains, including education, employment, migration, financial literacy, and the supply chain. Reaching a consensus was challenging, as each team member was passionate about different topics. However, after thorough discussion and a group vote, we agreed to focus on the U.S. retail supply chain. This topic aligns with our collective interests and represents a real-world issue that we are eager to analyze collaboratively, with the goal of identifying potential solutions.

## Problem Statement  

In recent years, the U.S. retail supply chain has experienced a dramatic transformation driven by the rise of e-commerce, heightened customer expectations for fast delivery, and increasing urbanization. While innovations such as same-day shipping and real-time package tracking have become common, delivery delays remain a persistent and costly challenge for retailers.

From industry giants like Amazon and Walmart to small online businesses, delayed shipments erode customer trust, inflate operational costs, and increase the volume of returns. According to *Statista* (2023), over 80% of American consumers expect delivery within two days, and nearly 70% report dissatisfaction when packages are delayed even once. Seasonal surges (e.g., holidays) and location-specific issues (e.g., traffic congestion in Los Angeles or winter storms in Chicago) further hinder timely fulfillment.

This issue is multifactorial, involving transportation bottlenecks, logistics coordination failures, carrier limitations, weather anomalies, and infrastructure weaknesses. The U.S. transportation system ranks only 17th globally in efficiency, and the country faces a shortage of more than 80,000 truck drivers (*ATA*, 2023). Delivery delays are not just inconvenient—they are systemic and require data-driven strategies for mitigation.

## Research Questions

### Main Research Question

- What are the key factors that contribute to delivery delays in the retail supply chain, and how can they be mitigated?

### Supporting Research Questions

- What transportation and environmental factors most significantly contribute to delivery delays in the U.S. retail supply chain, and how accurately can machine learning models predict these delays?
- How do environmental and event-based anomalies (e.g., weather, COVID-19) affect last-mile delivery delays in urban retail supply chains, and how accurately can machine learning models predict these delays?
- What are the major transportation and logistics-related causes of delivery delays in the U.S. retail supply chain, and how can predictive models help identify high-risk deliveries?
- How can machine learning be used to predict and reduce delivery delays in the U.S. retail supply chain based on traffic, weather, and logistics data?
- How can machine learning models improve the accuracy of demand forecasting in retail supply chains during seasonal fluctuations?
