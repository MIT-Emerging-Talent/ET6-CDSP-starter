# Domain Study: Guide

This `guide.md` file provides an orientation to the contents and structure of
the `0_domain_study` folder. This folder contains our group’s domain-level
understanding of the research question we are pursuing—centered around
financial inclusion, credit systems, and BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later).

Our research process is guided by systems thinking, where we understand each
topic not in isolation but as an interconnected part of the broader financial
and socio-economic system. This has shaped our analysis of how data, credit
scoring models, regulatory structures, user behaviors, and technological
interventions all influence financial outcomes.

## Folder Structure and Contents

### 1. `research_questions/`

This folder documents the evolution of our central inquiry. It contains:

- `initial_questions.md`: A record of early-stage questions and themes we
  explored through our literature review.

- `final_questions.md`: The final, actionable research questions that emerged
  from both our literature review and group discussions. These are the
  questions we are now pursuing using data science methods.

### 2. `sources/`

This folder contains the foundational materials we have studied, including:

- `sources.md`: A list of key academic papers, datasets, and articles that
  informed our domain understanding. Each source includes a brief summary
  and notes on how it influenced our thinking.

### 3. `README.md`

This file provides an overview of the entire `0_domain_study` folder. It
explains the research domain, links to relevant subfolders (questions,
sources), and gives an at-a-glance summary of our direction.

### 4. `guide.md` (this file)

You’re reading it! This file explains how to navigate the domain study
materials and how each file contributes to understanding our research domain.

## Our Approach

We apply systems thinking to structure our understanding of BNPL and its
intersection with financial inclusion. We focus on identifying:

- **Structural components**: Actors in the system (users, lenders, data
  brokers, regulators)

- **Behavioral patterns**: How usage behaviors like BNPL adoption relate to
  credit health

- **Purpose dynamics**: Who benefits from the system as currently designed?

Our research is rooted in real-world patterns but also reflects a personal
lens on financial vulnerability, particularly among young or underbanked
populations.

The deliverables from this folder will support Milestone 1 and guide the next
steps of our modeling, data acquisition, and analysis phases.
