# Domain Research — Olumide Kolawole

## 1. Original Group Research Question

What are the average wage trends for immigrants in their first five years
after arrival compared to native-born workers of the same age/gender?

---

## 2. Domain

**Labor Economics, Immigration Policy, Wage Equity**  
This research question sits at the intersection of labor economics and
immigration studies. It involves understanding wage disparities, the value
of foreign credentials, and the structural barriers immigrant workers face.
This study is especially relevant in the context of U.S. tech, where
immigration plays a significant role in the workforce.

---

## 3. My Suggested Refactored Version (PICOT-structured)

How do wage trajectories of recent immigrant software engineers differ from
native-born peers with similar age and experience, and how do interconnected
factors—such as recognition of foreign credentials, company hiring
practices, language barriers, and access to networks—shape these outcomes
within the U.S. tech labor system during their first five years?

---

## 4. Summary of My Understanding of the Problem Domain

- This topic is about economic mobility and fairness for immigrants in tech.
- Key terms: wage trajectory, immigrant status, labor market integration,
foreign credential recognition, structural bias.
- I was surprised by how often immigrants are underemployed despite having
strong skills, and how much wage progression depends on networks and referrals,
not just performance.

---

## 5. Initial Background Research

- Immigrant tech workers often start in lower-paid roles, even with equivalent qualifications.
- Foreign degrees are often undervalued.
- H1B visa holders are limited in job-switching, impacting wage growth.
- Language fluency and cultural fit bias can lead to slower promotions.

**Sources consulted:**

- U.S. Dept. of Labor H1B disclosure data
- Brookings Institution: "Immigrants in Tech: Pay Gaps and Systemic Barriers"
- Migration Policy Institute: "Credential Recognition in the U.S. Labor Market"

---

## 6. Constraints or Challenges I Noticed

- Wage data by immigration status is hard to get directly.
- It's difficult to isolate cause without longitudinal data.
- Cultural fit and bias are hard to quantify.
- We assume that wage differences are mostly systemic, but some variation may
be personal or contextual.

---

## 7. Stakeholders and Relevance

- Immigrant software engineers seeking fairness and opportunity.
- Employers who want to build equitable and diverse teams.
- Policy makers addressing workforce development and visa policy.
- Tech inclusion advocates focused on career pathways and mobility.

---

## 8. Early Insights or Patterns

- Wage gaps are widest in the first few years but may narrow over time.
- Referral-based hiring excludes many immigrants.
- Companies rarely have structured onboarding for international talent.

---

## 9. My Open Questions

- Can we find reliable proxies for immigrant status in datasets?
- How do different visa types (e.g., H1B vs. Green Card) affect wage mobility?
- Are there regional differences (e.g., Bay Area vs. Midwest)?

---

## 10. Final Thoughts

- I feel confident that this is a meaningful, researchable topic.
- We should focus on narrowing the scope early (e.g., only software engineers,
only H1B).
- We need to balance qualitative insight (user journey, interviews) with
quantitative trends (wage data).

---

## 11. Next Steps

- Personally: finish empathy map + find 2 strong datasets to propose.
- Group:
  - Assign focus areas (e.g., credential bias, hiring practices, data sourcing)
  - Create shared folder for readings + insights
  - Draft journey map and visual iceberg model

---

## 12. Other Ideas or Suggestions

- Include a 1-page employer checklist prototype for immigrant support
- Optional: connect to broader questions of digital inclusion or AI hiring tools
- Long-term idea: compare immigrants from different regions (Africa, Asia,
Latin America)

---

## Add-on: Systems Thinking Summary

- Event: Immigrant engineers earn less than native peers
- Pattern: Wage inequality persists across roles and firms
- Structure: Credential bias, hiring practices, visa limitations
- Mental Models: "U.S. experience is superior," "They should prove themselves first"

---

## Add-on: Design Thinking Flow

- Empathize: Understand immigrant engineers' lived wage experiences
- Define: Immigrant engineers face systemic barriers to wage growth in tech
- Ideate: Map causes (e.g., bias, credential devaluation, network gaps)
- Prototype: Create visual wage trajectory + support checklist
- Test: Share findings and get peer feedback for refinement

## User Journey Map (Immigrant Software Engineer)

### Persona

**Name:** Ayo  
**Background:** Immigrant from Nigeria, 3 years of software experience abroad  
**Visa:** H1B  
**Goal:** Build a stable, respected tech career in the U.S.  
**Needs:** Recognition of past experience, career growth, fair pay, mentorship

### Journey Timeline (Bullet Format)

- **Job Search (Before Arrival):**
  - Experience: Applies online, receives little response
  - Emotions: Confused, frustrated
  - Challenges: Resume filters, lack of U.S. references
  - Design Opportunities: Resume translation tools or global hiring initiatives

- **First Job (Year 1):**
  - Experience: Accepts a lower role than qualified for
  - Emotions: Grateful but undervalued
  - Challenges: Underemployment, language barriers
  - Design Opportunities: Targeted onboarding for foreign talent

- **Year 2–3:**
  - Experience: Works hard, seeks growth
  - Emotions: Anxious, driven
  - Challenges: Bias in performance reviews, isolation
  - Design Opportunities: Peer mentoring programs and sponsorship

- **Year 4:**
  - Experience: Begins applying for better roles
  - Emotions: Hopeful, cautious
  - Challenges: Limited referrals, vague growth paths
  - Design Opportunities: Equitable evaluation and internal mobility support

- **Year 5:**
  - Experience: Secures promotion or new job
  - Emotions: Proud, reflective
  - Challenges: Slower wage progression
  - Design Opportunities: Immigrant leadership development programs

### Seasonal Relevance

- January: Job search intensifies post-holidays; visa timelines tighten
- April: H1B application season – high stress for visa holders
- Summer: Performance reviews, growth expectations
- October: Budget planning – promotions or raises often discussed

### Key Emotions Across Timeline

- Year 1: Gratitude + confusion
- Year 2–3: Drive + fatigue
- Year 4: Determination + frustration
- Year 5: Validation + reflection

### What the Journey Shows

This isn't just about pay – it's about how systems reward or delay opportunity.
The emotional toll, compounded by institutional structures, creates long-term
inequality in growth, not just in income.
