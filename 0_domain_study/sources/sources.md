  2. **Essential purchases**:
   Groceries/utilities → 28% default correlation :cite[10]  
  3. **Digital footprints**:
   Disposable emails + VPN usage → 89% fraud probability :cite[6]:cite[8]  
  4. **Behavioral signals**:
   Late-night transactions + cart abandonment → 3.2× risk :cite[6]  
  5. **Repayment gaps**:
   > 7 days delay on first installment → 40% default rate :cite[2]  

- **ML Implementation Roadmap**:  
  1. **Data layer**:
   Ingest device fingerprints + repayment history via APIs :cite[2]:cite[6]  
  2. **Feature engineering**:  
     - Calculate **transaction velocity** (purchases/month)  
     - Flag **high-risk categories** (electronics, gift cards) :cite[8]  
  3. **Model selection**:  
     - **Random Forest**: F1=0.89 for commercial credit deterioration :cite[2]  
     - **SHAP values**: Explainability for triggers like DTI >40% :cite[2]  
  4. **Compliance**:
