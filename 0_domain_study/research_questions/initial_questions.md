# Initial Research Questions

## Main Questions

1. What is the long-term impact of BNPL usage patterns on consumer credit  
   health and financial stability?

2. Can we develop a machine learning model to predict which BNPL users  
   are at high risk of over-indebtedness or default, and what features  
   serve as the best early warning indicators?

3. To what extent do media sentiment, whale activity, and macroeconomic  
   factors drive regime-switching volatility in cryptocurrency markets,  
   and how does this affect the viability of major cryptocurrencies as  
   stable investment assets or transactional currencies?

4. What level of financial and technical literacy is required for  
   successful cryptocurrency adoption, and how do targeted educational  
   interventions affect crypto-based financial inclusion outcomes?
