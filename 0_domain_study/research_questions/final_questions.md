# Problem Overview and Research Framework

## Refined Main Questions

### Primary Research Question

How accurately can a machine learning model, using behavioral and
transactional data, predict over-indebtedness risk among Gen Z Buy Now,
Pay Later (BNPL) users within a 6-month horizon, and which features provide
the most reliable early-warning signals?

### Secondary Research Questions

1. **Methodological Question**: Which machine learning algorithms
   (XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Networks) perform best for BNPL
   risk prediction compared to traditional credit scoring approaches?

2. **Behavioral Pattern Question**: What BNPL usage patterns
   (payment timing, frequency, cross-platform usage) most strongly
   predict financial distress 30-90 days in advance?

3. **Feature Importance Question**: How do BNPL-specific behavioral features
   compare to traditional credit variables (FICO score, income, employment)
   in predictive power?

4. **Demographic Risk Question**: How do over-indebtedness risk patterns vary
   across age, income, and geographic demographics, and can models maintain
   fairness across these groups?

5. **Policy Application Question**: What regulatory interventions and consumer  
   protection measures would be most effective based on identified risk  
   indicators and early warning signals?

## Complete Research Question Framework

### Problem Definition

**The BNPL ecosystem creates systematic information asymmetries and
cross-platform  
debt accumulation that traditional credit risk assessment cannot address,
leading  
to preventable over-indebtedness among financially vulnerable populations who
use  
BNPL services believing they are safer than traditional credit.**

### Research Hypothesis

**BNPL-specific behavioral patterns (payment timing, usage acceleration,  
cross-platform activity) will demonstrate superior predictive power for  
over-indebtedness risk compared to traditional credit scoring variables.**  
**This will enable early warning systems that can prevent financial distress  
60-90 days before crisis points.**

### Technical Approach

**Develop ensemble machine learning models using synthetic BNPL user data that  
combines traditional credit features with novel behavioral indicators to  
predict over-indebtedness risk while maintaining interpretability for  
regulatory compliance and fairness across demographic groups.**

### Expected Contribution

**Create the first comprehensive machine learning framework
 for BNPL risk assessment that provides actionable insights
  for consumers, evidence-based recommendations for
   regulators, and practical tools for industry while advancing
    academic knowledge in fintech consumer protection.**
