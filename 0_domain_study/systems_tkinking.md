## 1. **Event (What We See)**

What happend in the war zones regarding the college students learning online?\
We have documeneted some observations on the reality of our problem according to personal experinces of the team members located in war-affected zones like Palestine, Ukraine, etc.\
Personal experiences of team members include ***learning*** and ***teaching*** in the inconveient conditions of war-affected zones.\
We can formulate our observation as the following:

* Students in war zones are struggling with online learning.
* Decreased academic performance and engagement are observed.
* Students report stress, fatigue, and inability to focus.
* Sudden drops in participation related to particular events in the conflict/war.
* Teachers struggle to maintain consistency in virtual classrooms.

## 2. **Pattern/Trend (What Has Been Happening Over Time?)**

Here we identify recurring issues or long-term trends and try put observations into context to better understand the reasons/causes of the problem.

* Continuous low attendance during periods of heightened violence.
* Repeated cycles of displacement results in re-enrollment delays.
* Persistent academic gaps compared to students in stable areas.
* Increased digital divide: Students in war zones lag behind technologically.
* Fluctuations in internet access due to infrastructure damage.
* Growing interest in AI tools to support personalized learning, but limited access and understanding.

## 3. **Structure (What Is Causing These Patterns?)**

We look at the deeper structures—systems, rules, and interconnections—that drive patterns.

* **Technical Physical infrastructure collapse:** The war has severely damaged essential infrastructure such as electricity grids and internet towers.
**Educational Physical Infrastructure Destruction:**
The destruction has impacted nearly all physical spaces where students might otherwise access educational resources, including:
  1. **University buildings and campuses**, many of which have been damaged or repurposed as temporary shelters for displaced civilians.
  2. **Shared workspaces and internet cafés**, which have become increasingly rare and prohibitively expensive to access due to high demand and limited availability.
  3. **Public libraries and other free or low-cost study environments**, which are either destroyed, inaccessible, or overcrowded.
* **Displacement cycle:** Students constantly move, making learning environments unstable.
* **Policy gaps:** Lack of contingency educational policy for crisis settings.
* **Educational systems not adapted:** Curricula and platforms not designed for unstable contexts.
* **Teacher training:** Teachers lack training for remote teaching under crisis.
* **Access to Devices and Technology:**
Many students lack access to laptops, tablets, or secure online platforms. This gap is driven by several war-related factors:
  1. **Destruction of personal and public devices**, resulting from direct airstrikes on civilian areas and educational institutions, as well as other military activities.
  2. **Loss of thousands of devices and personal belongings** during forced displacement under active conflict.
  3. **Lack or complete absence of technical support and repair services** for malfunctioning or damaged devices, leaving even salvageable equipment unusable.
* **Limited investment in AI education tools** in humanitarian responses.

## 4. **Mental Models (What Beliefs, Assumptions Are Driving the System?)**

Here we explore the often invisible attitudes, values, and worldviews that keep the structure in place.

* “Education can wait until after the war.” This assumptions is being said by students/educators who are left alone in the war without any support facing all challanges we have elaobrated in the [workflow](/0_domain_study/workflow.md)
* “Students in conflict zones cannot benefit from tech-based solutions.”
* “Online learning is inherently ineffective without stability.”
* “Mental health is secondary to academic performance.”
* Belief that war-affected students are beyond the reach of innovation.

| Layer            | Application to Problem Statement                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Event**        | Students perform poorly in online learning during war.                               |
| **Pattern**      | Cycles of low attendance, engagement, academic performance, digital divide.          |
| **Structure**    | Weak infrastructure, poor policy, untrained staff, platform mismatch.                |
| **Mental Model** | Education is non-priority in conflict, tech isn’t for emergencies, low expectations. |
