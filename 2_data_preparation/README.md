# Data Preparation

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for cleaning and preparing datasets
used in the project. Each notebook focuses on a specific raw data source and
produces a cleaned dataset for further analysis or modeling.

Each notebook includes:

- Data loading and inspection
- Cleaning steps (handling missing values, renaming columns, type conversion)
- Output of a cleaned CSV for downstream analysis

Refer to each notebook for detailed steps and variable descriptions.

This directory contains scripts and notebooks for cleaning and preparing our
financial datasets for analysis. Each script processes specific datasets and
outputs cleaned versions for use in our modeling and exploration work.

## üìä Script Overview

### Jupyter Notebooks

#### `01_clean_afdr_data.ipynb`

- **Input**: `../1_datasets/raw_data/afdr_a8.csv` (USDA Agricultural Finance
  Databook Table A8)
- **Purpose**: Cleans quarterly loan volume data across various loan sizes for
  U.S. farms
- **Processing**:
  - Renames messy column names to cleaner versions
    (e.g., "$1,000 to!$9,000" ‚Üí "$1k‚Äì9k")
  - Converts numeric columns to proper data types
  - Handles missing values by filling with 0
- **Output**: `../1_datasets/processed_datasets/afdr_cleaned.csv`
- **Use Case**: Provides historical insights into traditional loan structures
  for comparison with BNPL patterns

#### `02_clean_afdr_charts.ipynb`

- **Input**: `../1_datasets/raw_data/afdr_charts.csv` (USDA Agricultural
  Finance Databook Table A2)
- **Purpose**: Processes quarterly statistics on non-real-estate farm loans
  (volume, interest rates, loan sizes, floating-rate shares)
- **Processing**:
  - Renames columns to shorter, cleaner names
  - Ensures numerical values are float type
  - Handles missing values
- **Output**: `../1_datasets/reference/afdr_charts_cleaned.csv`
- **Use Case**: Historical benchmark for comparing financial behavior evolution
  (NOT used for modeling due to aggregated nature)

#### `03_clean_BNPL.ipynb`

- **Input**: `../1_datasets/raw_data/BNPL.csv` (Kaggle dataset with 1,000
  customer records)
- **Purpose**: Cleans BNPL user profiles with behavioral, financial, and
  demographic features
- **Processing**:
  - Validates data quality (checks for missing values, duplicates)
  - Ensures proper data types
  - No missing values found, minimal cleaning required
- **Output**: `../1_datasets/processed_datasets/BNPL_cleaned.csv`
- **Use Case**: Primary dataset for BNPL default risk modeling with features
  like:
  - `failed_traditional_credit`, `over_indebtedness_flag`,
    `financial_stress_score`
  - `bnpl_usage_frequency`, `payment_delinquency_count`,
    `credit_limit_utilisation`

#### `04_clean_BNPL_intention_to_use.ipynb`

  survey data)
- **Purpose**: Processes survey responses from 226 young shoppers on BNPL
  adoption intentions
- **Processing**:
  - Handles Likert-scale responses for behavioral constructs
  - Validates data types and missing values
  - Preserves coded headers (FL1, PE3, etc.) for behavioral analysis
- **Output**: `../1_datasets/reference/BNPL_intention_to_use_cleaned.csv`
- **Use Case**: Exploratory analysis of attitudes and intentions (NOT for
  modeling due to lack of outcome labels)

#### `05_clean_FRBNY-SCE-Credit-Access-complete_microdata.ipynb`

- **Input**: `../1_datasets/raw_data/FRBNY-SCE-Credit-Access-complete_microdata.xlsx`

  Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE) Credit Access microdata (2013-2017)
- **Processing**:
  - Extracts column names from second row and data from third row onwards
  - Removes empty rows and columns
  - Cleans column names (spaces to underscores, removes special characters)
  - Renames columns using comprehensive mapping
    (e.g., `userid` ‚Üí `respondent_id`, `n1_1` ‚Üí `has_credit_card`)
  - Handles credit product ownership, balances, applications, and denial reasons
- **Output**: `../1_datasets/processed_datasets/FRBNY_SCE_Credit_Access_cleaned.csv`
- **Use Case**: Individual-level credit access patterns and borrowing behavior
  analysis

#### `create_complete_data.py`

- **Input**: `../1_datasets/processed_datasets/FRBNY_SCE_Credit_Access_cleaned.csv`
- **Purpose**: Creates a subset of the SCE data with only complete columns
  (no missing values)
- **Processing**:
  - Identifies columns with no missing values
  - Creates subset with only complete columns
  - Removes completely empty rows
- **Output**: `../1_datasets/processed_datasets/FRBNY_SCE_Credit_Access_complete_columns.csv`
- **Use Case**: Provides a clean dataset for modeling when complete cases are
  required
