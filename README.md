# 📊 Mathematics After COVID-19

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and understand the global gap in mathematics proficiency among primary school students before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The work focuses on comparing learning outcomes between 2019 and 2023 and exploring the possible role of factors such as:

- School closures  
- Education spending  
- Digital connectivity  
- Access to trained teachers

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Quantify the change in math proficiency across countries.  
- Identify patterns and factors that may have contributed to the learning gap.  
- Provide insights through visualizations and models to better understand the educational impact of the pandemic.

---

## 🔍 What We Did

- Collected and combined data from multiple international sources.  
- Focused on comparing math proficiency before (2019) and after (2023) the pandemic.  
- Investigated possible explanations for the learning gap, such as school closures, access to technology, and education spending.

---

## 💡 Key Questions

- How much did math proficiency change during the pandemic?  
- Which countries or regions were most affected?  
- What factors are most strongly associated with greater learning loss?
