## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository captures the process of our data science project, from
identifying the initial problem to delivering the final presentation. Our
approach emphasizes collaborative problem-solving, careful analysis, and clear
communication to enable actionable insights.

 🔍 Domain Focus: Our research explores how young displaced individuals in the U.S. — especially those without prior
tech experience — can access sustainable IT careers. We compare formal pathways like universities with non-traditional
options such as bootcamps and online certifications to identify the most accessible,
supportive, and employer-relevant routes.

### 📋 Project Milestones

This project follows the Collaborative Data Science Project (CDSP)
 structure. It is organized around six key milestones:

- Cross-Cultural Collaboration – Team setup, communication planning, and tooling
  - Milestone 0 [Retrospective](collaboration/retrospectives/0_cross_cultural_collaboration.md)
- Problem Identification – Define the research question and explore the domain
  - See our [Domain Study on Career Pathways into IT for Displaced Youth](0_domain_study)
  - Milestone 1 [Retrospective](collaboration/retrospectives/1_problem_identification.md)
- Data Collection – Gather, clean, and document data
  - Milestone 2 [Retrospective](collaboration/retrospectives/2_data_collection.md)
- Data Analysis – Analyze data and interpret results
  - Milestone 3 [Retrospective](collaboration/retrospectives/3_data_analysis.md)
- Communicating Results – Prepare materials for a target audience
  - Milestone 4 [Retrospective](collaboration/retrospectives/4_communicating_results.md)
- Final Presentation – Summarize key insights and team reflections
  - Milestone 5 [Retrospective](collaboration/retrospectives/5_final_presentation.md)

A detailed checklist for each milestone is available in the
[official CDSP syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TaoVVqJD5EqmBGLw6_qzph8EZnuL6uhY/edit?tab=t.0).
