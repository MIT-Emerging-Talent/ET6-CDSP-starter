## 📊 Analyzing and Investigating Supply Chain Delays: A Data-Driven Approach

### 🧩 Problem Statement

Despite being one of the world’s most developed economies, the United States
continues to face nationwide retail supply chain delays, affecting both large
chains and small-to-mid-sized businesses. These disruptions are especially
severe during peak periods like holidays, back-to-school seasons, and major
promotional events, resulting in stockouts, delivery delays, and lost customer
trust.
A 2021 report by [the National Retail Federation](https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nrf-calls-white-house-address-port-congestion-challenges)
revealed that 97% of U.S.
retailers experienced shipping or port delays, [with 70% reporting delays of two
to three weeks](https://splash247.com/biden-pressured-to-fix-us-port-congestion-issues/).
Additionally, [the U.S. is
short over 78,000 truck drivers in
late 2022](https://www.trucknews.com/human-resources/u-s-is-short-78000-drivers-ata-says/1003170001/),
contributing to late
deliveries and increased freight costs. Lead
times for replenishment and raw materials have increased by up to 30 to 40
days, while [65% of grocery and retail merchants lack real-time supply chain
data](https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2025/65percent-of-grocery-retailers-lack-real-time-supply-chain-data/),
this reduces
their ability to respond dynamically to disruptions.
These delays are not confined to specific geographies—they affect retail
operations nationwide, from large coastal distribution hubs to inner-city
stores. As a result, businesses struggle to maintain inventory balance, meet
demand, and compete with more digitally advanced competitors like Amazon, which
leverage predictive analytics and automation.
This growing gap between the current state of retail supply chain operations
and the desired state of responsive, tech-enabled systems highlights the urgent
need for scalable solutions. Addressing this issue is critical to improving
customer satisfaction, reducing operational costs, and preserving the
competitiveness of the U.S. retail sector.

### 🔍 Research Questions

#### ✅ **An Actionable Research Question**

**What are the key factors that contribute to delivery delays in the retail
supply chain, and how can they be mitigated?**

#### 📌 **Supporting/Exploratory Questions**

1. What transportation and environmental factors most significantly contribute
to delivery delays in the U.S. retail supply chain, and how accurately can
machine learning models predict these delays?

2. How do environmental and event-based anomalies (e.g., weather, COVID) affect
last-mile delivery delays in urban retail supply chains, and how accurately can
machine learning models predict these delays?

3. What are the major transportation and logistics-related causes of delivery
delays in the U.S. retail supply chain, and how can predictive models help
identify high-risk deliveries?

4. How can machine learning be used to predict and reduce delivery delays in
the U.S. retail supply chain based on traffic, weather, and logistics data?

### 🧠 Systems Thinking Approach

#### 🕸 Understanding Delivery Delays in the U.S. Retail Supply Chain

We understand that delivery delays in the U.S. retail supply chain is the
outcome of multiple interdependent systems. Using systems thinking, we analyzed
how infrastructure, labor shortages, environmental variability, consumer
expectations, and technological limitations interact to produce a recurring
pattern of delivery disruptions. From this lens, our team’s approach is to
understand the leverage points where smarter interventions can improve
resilience across the system.

### ❄️ The Iceberg Model: Understanding Systemic Delivery Delays

#### 📍 Event

The end user experiences a delayed shipment beyond its expected delivery time.
Consumers, both individuals and businesses, experience missing delivery
windows, tracking errors, or unfulfilled expectations. But this event is just
the tip of the iceberg, in which the end user has minimal capability to
understand.

#### 📈 Patterns & Trends

Delays spike during holidays, in congested cities, or under severe weather
conditions.
These patterns are not random. We consistently observe delays in:

- Urban centers like Los Angeles and NYC (traffic congestion, density)
- Winter-prone areas like Chicago (weather disruptions)
- Seasonal surges (Black Friday, Christmas)
- During national labor shortages or strikes

#### 🏗️ Systemic Structures

**Why do these delays persist despite tech and logistics innovation?**

Underlying structures create the conditions for recurring delays:

- Outdated or underfunded transportation infrastructure
- Long-term truck driver shortages (80,000+ unfilled positions, ATA 2023)
- Fragmented communication between warehouses, carriers, and platforms
- Uniform delivery guarantees that don’t adjust for local or temporal realities
- Reactive scheduling and lack of data-driven optimization
- Fatigued labor, minimal buffer time, and rigid delivery windows

These structural flaws create bottlenecks and friction points that increase
system stress during peak demand.

#### 💭 Mental Models

**What beliefs sustain these fragile systems?**

- The belief that faster is always better encourages unrealistic promises and
over-optimistic routing.
- Automation will fix everything, ignoring socio-environmental realities like
human fatigue and weather patterns.
- When an entity believes delays are external, not internal, it shifts the
blame to weather or drivers, rather than poor planning or systemic
inflexibility.
- The concept that the customer is always right pressures the system into
overpromising and overextending.

These mental models limit innovation, reduce flexibility, and intensify
systemic fragility.
