## üìä About Our Project

Welcome to **DataCents** - where we decode financial patterns to understand default
risks in the BNPL and traditional lending systems. üåüüéØ

## üîç What is DataCents?

> **DataCents** DataCents is a collaborative data science project investigating
> how demographic and behavioral features influence the risk of default in Buy Now,
> Pay Later (BNPL) services and traditional loans.
>
> We are analyzing multiple datasets to answer the core question: "How do
> demographic and financial behavior features influence the likelihood of
> default across traditional loans and Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services?" üìàü§î

### üéØ Our Mission

[![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-success?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-15-repo)

We're on a mission to:

- Understand key indicators of default across both BNPL and traditional credit ecosystems

- Identify behavioral and demographic factors that shape financial risk

- Build insights that can help inform better policy, financial education, and
  early interventions for Gen Z consumers

## üß† Problem statement

BNPL services create invisible debt accumulation across multiple
platforms that neither consumers nor traditional credit monitoring
systems can effectively track, leading to unexpected financial
stress and over-indebtedness among young adults who believe
they are managing their finances responsibly.

Traditional loans, while more regulated, are also susceptible to default due to
poor credit behavior, lack of transparency, or poor access to financial literacy.
Understanding the interplay between both mechanisms is crucial.

### Research Question

How do demographic and financial behavior features influence the likelihood
of default across traditional loans and Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services?

### üîç Modeling the Research Question

To model this research question, we collected, cleaned, and integrated diverse data
sources that include demographic characteristics, credit behavior, and loan
attributes. Our modeling process involves:

- **Data Integration**: Combining relevant public and survey datasets that cover
  both BNPL and traditional credit usage.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating variables that capture behavioral indicators
  such as frequency of borrowing, loan size distribution, income-to-debt ratios,
  and time to repayment.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Understanding statistical trends and correlation patterns
  to inform feature selection.
- **Modeling Techniques**: Using classification algorithms (*Logistic Regression,
  Random Forest, XGBoost*) to predict likelihood of default.
- **Interpretability Tools**: Using SHAP values and feature importance analysis to
  explain model behavior.

## üìÅ Datasets Used

We documented and curated all our datasets in the
[`/1_datasets/`](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-15-repo/tree/main/1_datasets)
folder of our GitHub repository. This includes both modeling-ready and
contextual datasets, each with relevant metadata and cleaning scripts in the [`/2_data_preparation/`](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-15-repo/tree/main/2_data_preparation)
folder.

**Key features include:**

- BNPL usage patterns, credit intention, and financial behavior metrics  
- Traditional loan characteristics, defaults, and borrower traits  
- Credit access and maturity structure from macro-level sources  

For a full list and details, visit: [`/1_datasets/`](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-15-repo/tree/main/1_datasets)

Each dataset was preprocessed in the
[`/2_data_preparation/`](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-15-repo/tree/main/2_data_preparation)
folder with steps including:

- Cleaning missing and anomalous values  
- Standardizing time formats  
- Renaming columns for clarity  
- Merging and aggregating loan segments  

> **Note**: Some datasets such as *FRBNY SCE* were used more for contextual
> understanding and trend visualization, and not for predictive modeling
> due to aggregated structure.
