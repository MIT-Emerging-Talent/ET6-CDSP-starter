## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository captures the process of our data science project, from
identifying the initial problem to delivering the final presentation. Our
approach emphasizes collaborative problem-solving, careful analysis, and clear
 communication to enable actionable insights.

### 📋 Project Milestones

This project follows the Collaborative Data Science Project (CDSP)
 structure. It is organized around six key milestones:

- Cross-Cultural Collaboration – Team setup, communication planning, and tooling
- Problem Identification – Define the research question and explore the domain
- Data Collection – Gather, clean, and document data
- Data Analysis – Analyze data and interpret results
- Communicating Results – Prepare materials for a target audience
- Final Presentation – Summarize key insights and team reflections
A detailed checklist for each milestone is available in the official CDSP syllabus.
