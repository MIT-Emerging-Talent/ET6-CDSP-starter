# Blockchain for Financial Inclusion: Identity and Credit Access for Migrants

## 🌍 Project Overview

This collaborative research project explores whether
**blockchain-based identity and credit systems** can offer a
**viable solution to financial exclusion** among
**migrants and refugees** who are often shut out of traditional banking services
due to the lack of formal documentation or credit histories.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Migrants and refugees frequently face **systemic barriers to financial
services**—from bank accounts and credit access to insurance—due to limited or
non-existent formal identity, credit records, or residency status. Conventional
financial systems often fail to serve this population, contributing to economic
marginalization and social exclusion.

This project investigates the potential of **blockchain technology**—with its
decentralized, secure, and tamper-resistant capabilities—to provide alternative
identity verification and credit-building mechanisms that could enable fairer,
more inclusive access to financial services.
