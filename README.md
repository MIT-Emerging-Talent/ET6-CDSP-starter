# Barriers to Justice

How Immigration Policies Affect Immigrant Juveniles Seeking Protection

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore how recent changes in U.S. immigration
policy under the current administration are affecting immigrant juveniles’
access to legal representation and the outcomes of their protection cases.

Our key questions include:

- How have recent policy shifts impacted access to legal aid for immigrant juveniles?
- What are the trends in case outcomes for unrepresented versus represented youth?
- What structural or systemic factors contribute to the legal gap?

## Problem Statement

Immigrant juveniles in the U.S. face serious barriers to legal
representation, especially under recent changes in immigration policy.
These policies have increased case backlogs, limited access to legal aid,
and negatively affected outcomes for children seeking protection.
Our group aims to understand how these systemic issues shaped by shifting
policies, institutional structures, and public attitudes impact vulnerable
youth and what can be done to improve fairness and access to justice.

## Understanding the Problem Domain

We applied systems thinking to the topic domain to understand the complex,
interconnected issues immigrant juveniles face in accessing legal representation
and reuniting with family in the U.S.
These systemic challenges result from increasingly restrictive immigration
policies, funding instability, enforcement practices, and underlying beliefs
about immigrant children and legal rights.

structures, and underlying mental models, check out the full overview:

## Actionable Research Question

***"How do changes in U.S. immigration policy under the current administration
affect access to legal representation and outcomes for immigrant juveniles
seeking protection?"***

### Context & Constraints

- **Domain:** U.S. immigration law and policy, focused on juveniles (minors) seeking
legal protection (e.g., asylum, Special Immigrant Juvenile Status).

- **Realities:** Immigration policy is dynamic and politically influenced; juvenile
immigrants face complex barriers navigating the legal system; access to legal
counsel is crucial for fair outcomes.

- **Constraints:**
  - **Data Availability:** Data on representation and case outcomes may be fragmented
  (court records, NGO data, government statistics). Policy changes may not be
  immediately or transparently reflected in public data.  
  - **Ethical/Legal:** Privacy concerns for minors; potential bias in available datasets.
  - **Temporal/Geographical Scope:** Defining the appropriate time window may be
  required. The study can be nationwide or limited to areas with sufficient or
  high-priority data.
