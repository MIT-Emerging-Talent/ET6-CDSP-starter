# 🌿 Team GreenFrontier

Welcome to the collaboration space for **Team GreenFrontier** – Group 02 of the
MIT Emerging Talent program __CDSP.

We are a team of aspiring data scientists working together to build strong
 collaboration skills, grow through shared learning, and prepare for
  impactful data science projects. Our focus is on clear communication,
   mutual respect, and continuous development as a team.

Stay tuned for updates as we define and begin our project journey!

## 📚 Background Review (Summary)

  Climate change is intensifying the frequency and severity of heat waves
  across urban areas, especially in rapidly developing countries like Nigeria.
  Combined with unreliable energy infrastructure, heat events increase the
  risk for residents who lack access to cooling systems or dependable electricity.
  Rising temperatures can also strain electrical grids, leading to further outages.
  Nigeria’s urban centers — particularly Lagos — are experiencing growing energy
  demands and increasing temperatures, making the intersection of climate, energy,
  and public health a critical domain for investigation.

## 🧠 Systems Thinking Summary

This problem lies at the intersection of multiple systems:

- **Environmental system:** Climate change is increasing heat intensity.
- **Infrastructure system:** Inadequate and aging electricity infrastructure
   fails during demand surges.
- **Social system:** Vulnerable populations are least able to afford
  backup energy solutions.
- **Economic system:** Energy pricing structures disproportionately burden
  low-income households.
  These interlinked systems lead to compounding vulnerabilities. Addressing
  one area (e.g., public health) without considering others (e.g., energy
  pricing or infrastructure) can lead to unintended consequences.

## ❓ Research Question

  How have the duration and peak intensity of summertime heat waves (X) changed
  over the 1990 – 2024 period (Y) in rapidly urbanising metropolitan areas (Z),
  and what does that imply for public-health officials, energy utilities, and
  heat-vulnerable residents?

  This question aims to use historical climate data and urban development trends
  to inform better decision-making for those managing energy, health, and city planning.

## 👥 Stakeholders

- **Public health officials** – e.g., city hospitals, emergency response agencies
- **Energy utilities** – e.g., electricity distribution companies.
- **Urban planners** – e.g., Lagos State Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban
   Development.
- **Heat-vulnerable residents** – e.g., elderly individuals, children, low-income
  households living in poorly ventilated buildings.
