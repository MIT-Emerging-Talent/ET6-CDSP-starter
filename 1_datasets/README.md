# Datasets

This folder contains data sources compiled for our research into blockchain-based identity and credit systems for improving financial inclusion among migrants and refugees.

We structured this folder into three key documentation files, each focusing on a different type of data: raw datasets, supporting articles, and statistical references.

## 📂 RAWDATA.md  

This file summarizes the **raw datasets** used in our research. It includes links, brief descriptions, and source information for each dataset related to migrant demographics, financial inclusion, and decentralized technology systems.  

The folder `raw_datasets_files` contains the raw datasets used for our research into whether blockchain-based identity and credit systems can help address financial exclusion among migrants and refugees. As per the repository guidelines, these files are kept in their **original, unmodified state**.

## 📄 articles.md  

This document explores whether blockchain-based identity and credit systems can offer a viable solution to **financial exclusion among migrants and refugees**, who are often excluded from traditional banking due to the **lack of formal documentation or credit histories**.
