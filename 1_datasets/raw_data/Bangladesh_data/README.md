# 🇧🇩 Bangladesh School Data

This folder contains student-level math performance data collected
 from a school in Bangladesh.  
It is used as a case study to support the global findings of our project.

## 🧾 Description

This dataset includes math scores from **seventh-grade students**
 for three academic years:

- **2019** (pre-pandemic)
- **2020** (pandemic disruption year)
- **2021** (early recovery)

Each row represents one student with their math score, gender,
 academic year, and class.

**Important:**  
Each year includes a **different cohort of 150 students**.  
This is a **cross-sectional** dataset, not longitudinal
 — students are not tracked across years.

## 🎯 Purpose in Project

The dataset serves as a **supplementary case study** from
 a lower-middle-income country  
to illustrate learning disruption at the student level.
 It complements the main dataset,  
which is based on national-level indicators.

This data was not merged with the main country-level dataset  
but was used to confirm and visualize the learning loss trend locally.

## ⚠️ Notes

- The original dataset included student names, which were removed for privacy reasons.
- The cleaned version `class7_math_results.cleaned.csv` contains
   **no personally identifiable information** (PII).
- The dataset is not nationally representative, but offers
   insight into local pandemic effects.
